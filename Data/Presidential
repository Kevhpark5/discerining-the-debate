Speaker,Labels,tokenized
clinton,1, thank you very much chris and thanks to unlv for hosting us
clinton,1,you know i think when we talk about the supreme court it really raises the central issue in this election
clinton,1,namely what kind of country are we going to be
clinton,1,what kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens
clinton,1,what kind of rights will americans have
clinton,1,and i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people
clinton,1,not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy
clinton,1,for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system
clinton,1,i have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the supreme court
clinton,1,but i feel that at this point in our countrys history it is important that we not reverse marriage equality that we not reverse roe v wade that we stand up against citizens united we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace that we stand up and basically say the supreme court should represent all of us
clinton,1,thats how i see the court
clinton,1,and the kind of people that i would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful standing up on behalf of our rights as americans
clinton,1,and i look forward to having that opportunity
clinton,1,i would hope that the senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that president obama has sent to them
clinton,1,thats the way the constitution fundamentally should operate
clinton,1,the president nominates and the senate advises and consents or not
clinton,1,but they go forward with the process
clinton,1, thank you
clinton,1,are you a teacher
clinton,1,yes i think thats a very good question because i heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of our concerns about some of the things being said and done in this campaign
clinton,1,and i think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we are good
clinton,1,and we are going to respect one another lift each other up
clinton,1,we are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl as well as every adult to bring them into working on behalf of our country
clinton,1,i have a positive and optimistic view of what we can do together
clinton,1,that’s why the slogan of my campaign is stronger together
clinton,1,because i think if we work together if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets americans against one another and instead we make some big goals and i’ve set forth some big goals getting the economy to work for everyone not just those at the top
clinton,1,making sure we have the best education from preschool through college and making it affordable and so much else
clinton,1,if we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them there is nothing in my opinion america cant do
clinton,1,i hope we will all come together in this campaign
clinton,1,obviously im hoping to earn your vote i’m hoping to be elected in november and i can promise you i will work with every american
clinton,1,i want to be the president for all americans regardless of your political beliefs what you look like your religion
clinton,1,i want us to heal our country and bring it together
clinton,1,because thats i think the best way to get the future that our children and grandchildren deserve
clinton,1, well first of all it’s so great to be with you and thank you everybody
clinton,1,the supreme court it is what it is all about
clinton,1,our country is so so it is just so imperative that we have the right justices
clinton,1,something happened recently where justice ginsburg made some very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people
clinton,1,many many millions of people that i represent and she was forced to apologize
clinton,1,and apologize she did
clinton,1,but these were statements that should never ever have been made
clinton,1,we need a supreme court that in my opinion is going to uphold the second amendment and all amendments but the second amendment which is under absolute siege
clinton,1,i believe if my opponent should win this race which i truly dont think will happen we will have a second amendment which will be a very very small replica of what it is right now
clinton,1,but i feel that it is absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma
clinton,1,i feel that the justices that i am going to appoint and ive named 20 of them
clinton,1,the justices that i am going to appoint will be pro life
clinton,1,they will have a conservative bent
clinton,1,they will be protecting the second amendment
clinton,1,they are great scholars in all cases and theyre people of tremendous respect
clinton,1,they will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted and i believe that’s very important
clinton,1,i dont think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear
clinton,1,it is all about the constitution of and it is so important
clinton,1,the constitution the way it was meant to be
clinton,1,and those are the people that i will appoint
trump,0, thank you
trump,0,are you a teacher
trump,0,yes i think thats a very good question because i heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of our concerns about some of the things being said and done in this campaign

trump,0,the constitution the way it was meant to be
trump,0,and those are the people that i will appoint
trump,0, well i’ll actually agree with that
trump,0,i agree with everything she said
trump,0,i began this campaign because i was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country
trump,0,this is a great country
trump,0,this is a great land
trump,0,i have gotten to know the people of the country over the last year and a half that i have been doing this as a politician
trump,0,i cannot believe im saying that about myself but i guess i have been a politician
trump,0,and my whole concept was to make america great again
trump,0,when i watch the deals being made
trump,0,when i watch whats happening with some horrible things like obamacare where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical 68% 59% 71%
trump,0,when i look at the iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us it’s a one sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state really the number one terrorist state we’ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago
trump,0,when i look at all of the things that i see and all of the potential that our country has we have such tremendous potential
trump,0,whether its in business and trade where we are doing so badly
trump,0,last year we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit
trump,0,in other words trading with other countries
trump,0,we had an $800 billion deficit
trump,0,it’s hard to believe
trump,0,inconceivable
trump,0,you say who’s making these deals
trump,0,we’re going to make great trade deals we‘re going to have a strong border we’re going to bring back law and order
trump,0,just today policeman was shot
trump,0,two killed
trump,0,and this is happening on a weekly basis
trump,0,we have to bring back respect to law enforcement
trump,0,at the same time we have to take cake of people on all sides
trump,0,we need justice
trump,0,but i want to do things that haven’t been done including fixing and making our inner cities better for the african american citizens that are so great and for the latinos hispanics and i looking forward to doing  it’s called make america great again
trump,0, well first of all i support the second amendment
trump,0,i lived in arkansas for 18 wonderful years
trump,0,i represented upstate new york
trump,0,i understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership that goes back to the founding of our country but i also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation
trump,0,because i support the second amendment doesnt mean that i want people who shouldnt have guns to be able to threaten you kill you or members of your family
trump,0,and so when i think about what we need to do we have 33000 people a year who die from guns
trump,0,i think we need comprehensive background checks need to close the online loophole close the gun show loophole
trump,0,there’s other matters that i think are sensible that are the kinds of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the second amendment
trump,0,you mentioned the heller decision and what i was saying that you referenced chris was that i disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case
trump,0,because what the district of columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns
trump,0,and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them
trump,0,and the court did not accept that reasonable regulation but theyve accepted many others
trump,0,so i see no conflict between saving peoples lives and defending the second amendment
clinton,1, well i’ll actually agree with that
clinton,1,i agree with everything she said
clinton,1,i began this campaign because i was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country
clinton,1,this is a great country

clinton,1, how are you donald
trump,0, no i didn’t say that at all
trump,0,i dont think you understood what was said
trump,0,this was locker room talk
trump,0,i am not proud of it
trump,0,i apologize to my family i apologized to the american people
trump,0,certainly i am not proud of it
trump,0,but this is locker room talk
trump,0,you know when we have a world where you have isis chopping off heads where you have them frankly drowning people in steel cages where you have wars and horrible horrible sights all over and you have so many bad things happening this is like medieval times
trump,0,we haven’t seen anything likes this
trump,0,the carnage all over the world and they look and they see can you imagine the people that are frankly doing so well against us with isis and they look at our country and see whats going on
trump,0,yes i am very embarrassed by it and i hate it but its locker room talk and it’s one of those things
trump,0,i will knock the hell out of isis
trump,0,we are going to defeat isis
trump,0,isis happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment
trump,0,and i will tell you i will take care of isis
trump,0,we need to get on to much more important and bigger things
trump,0, well the dc versus heller decision was very strongly and she was extremely angry about it
trump,0,i watched
trump,0,i mean she was very very angry when upheld
trump,0,and justice scalia was so involved and it was a well crafted decision
trump,0,but hillary was extremely upset
trump,0,extremely angry
trump,0,and people that believe in the second amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say
trump,0, no i didn’t say that at all
trump,0,i dont think you understood what was said
trump,0,this was locker room talk
trump,0,i am not proud of it
trump,0,i apologize to my family i apologized to the american people

trump,0,extremely angry
trump,0,and people that believe in the second amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say
trump,0, i have great respect for women
trump,0,nobody has more respect for women than i do
trump,0, well i was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers injure themselves even kill people with guns because unfortunately not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions
trump,0,but there is no doubt that i respect the second amendment
trump,0,that i also believe there is an individual right to bear arms
trump,0,that is not in conflict with sensible common sense regulation
trump,0,and you know look
trump,0,i understand that donald has been strongly supported by the nra the gun lobby is on his side
trump,0,theyre running millions of dollars of ads against me and i regret that because what i would like to see is for people to come together and say of course were going to protect and defend the second amendment
trump,0,but were going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33000 lives that we lose every year
clinton,1, i have great respect for women
clinton,1,nobody has more respect for women than i do
clinton,1, well i was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers injure themselves even kill people with guns because unfortunately not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions

clinton,1,but were going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33000 lives that we lose every year
trump,0, frankly you hear these things
trump,0,they are said
trump,0,and i was am embarrassed by it
trump,0,but i have respect for women  
trump,0, well let me just tell you before we go any further in chicago which has the toughest gun laws in the united states probably you could say by far they have more gun violence than any other city
trump,0,so we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence
trump,0,i am a very strong supporter of the second amendment
trump,0,and i dont know if hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner but im very proud to have the endorsement of the nra and it was the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to anybody who ran for president
trump,0,so im very honored by all of that
trump,0,we are going to appoint justices this is the best way to help the second amendment
trump,0,we are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the second amendment
trump,0,that will not do damage to the second amendment
trump,0, frankly you hear these things
trump,0,they are said
trump,0,and i was am embarrassed by it
trump,0,but i have respect for women

trump,0,we are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the second amendment
trump,0,that will not do damage to the second amendment
trump,0,    and they have respect for me
trump,0,and i will tell you no i have not
trump,0,and i will tell you that i’m going to make our country safe and we’re going to have borders which we dont have now
trump,0,people are pouring into our country and they’re coming in from the middle east and other places
trump,0,we’re gonna make america safe again we’re gonna make america great again but we’re gonna make america safe again and we’re gonna make america wealthy again
trump,0,because if you dont do that it just it sounds harsh to say but we have to build up the wealth of our nation
trump,0,other nations are taking our job and they’re taking our wealth
trump,0, well if that would happen because i am pro life and i will be appointing pro life judges i would think that would go back to the individual states
trump,0,    and they have respect for me
trump,0,and i will tell you no i have not
trump,0,and i will tell you that i’m going to make our country safe and we’re going to have borders which we dont have now

trump,0,other nations are taking our job and they’re taking our wealth
trump,0, well if that would happen because i am pro life and i will be appointing pro life judges i would think that would go back to the individual states
clinton,1, well thank you lester and thanks to hofstra for hosting us
clinton,1,the central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future well build together
clinton,1,today is my granddaughters second birthday so i think about this a lot
clinton,1,first we have to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top
clinton,1,that means we need new jobs good jobs with rising incomes
clinton,1, well like everyone else i’ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw
clinton,1,you know with prior republican nominees for president i disagreed with them on politics policies principles but i never questioned their fitness to serve
clinton,1,donald trump is different
clinton,1,i said starting back in june that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief
clinton,1,and many republicans and independents have said the same thing
clinton,1,what we all saw and heard on friday was donald talking about women what he thinks about women what he does to women and he has said that the video doesn’t represent who he is
clinton,1,but i think its clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is
clinton,1,because we have seen this throughout the campaign
clinton,1,we have seen him insult women
clinton,1,we have seen him rate women on their appearance ranking them from one to ten we’ve seen him embarrass women on tv and on twitter
clinton,1,we saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former miss universe in the harshest most personal terms
clinton,1,so yes this is who donald trump is
clinton,1,but its not only women and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president
clinton,1,because he has also targeted immigrants african americans latinos people with disabilities pows muslims and so many others
clinton,1,so this is who donald trump is
clinton,1,and the question for us the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are
clinton,1,thats why to go back to your question i want to send a message
clinton,1,we all should to every boy and girl and indeed to the entire world
clinton,1,that america already is great but we are great because we are good
clinton,1,and we will respect one another and we will work with one another and we will celebrate our diversity
clinton,1,these are very important values to me because this is the america that i know and love
clinton,1,and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if im so fortunate enough to become your president
clinton,1, if they overturned it it would go back to the states
clinton,1,the central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future well build together

trump,0,and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if im so fortunate enough to become your president
trump,0, if they overturned it it would go back to the states
clinton,1,i want us to invest in you
clinton,1,i want us to invest in your future
clinton,1,that means jobs in infrastructure in advanced manufacturing innovation and technology clean renewable energy and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business
clinton,1,we also have to make the economy fairer
clinton,1,that starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee finally equal pay for womens work
clinton,1, i also want to see more companies do profit sharing
clinton,1,if you help create the profits you should be able to share in them not just the executives at the top
clinton,1, i’d like to respond to that
clinton,1,i assume i can
clinton,1, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on that is really what will happen
clinton,1,that will happen automatically in my opinion
clinton,1,because i am putting pro life justices on the court
clinton,1,i will say this
clinton,1,it will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination
trump,0, i also want to see more companies do profit sharing
trump,0,if you help create the profits you should be able to share in them not just the executives at the top
trump,0, i’d like to respond to that

trump,0,because i am putting pro life justices on the court
trump,0,i will say this
trump,0,it will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination
clinton,1,and i want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work
clinton,1,ive heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that youre under
clinton,1,so lets have paid family leave earned sick days
clinton,1,lets be sure we have affordable child care and debt free college
clinton,1, well i strongly support roe v wade which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate most difficult in many cases decisions about her health care that one can imagine
clinton,1,and in this case it is not only about roe v wade
clinton,1,it is about what is happening right now in america
clinton,1,so many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding planned parenthood which of course provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country
clinton,1,donald has said he is in favor of defunding planned parenthood
clinton,1,he even supported shutting the government down to defund planned parenthood
clinton,1,i will defend planned parenthood
clinton,1,i will defend roe v wade and i will defend womens rights to make their own healthcare decisions
clinton,1,we have come too far to have that turn back now
clinton,1,and indeed he said women should be punished
clinton,1,there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions
clinton,1,and i could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking
clinton,1,and i want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work
clinton,1,ive heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that youre under
clinton,1,so lets have paid family leave earned sick days

clinton,1,and indeed he said women should be punished
clinton,1,there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions
clinton,1,and i could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking
clinton,1,how are we going to do it
clinton,1,were going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes
clinton,1, its just words folks
clinton,1,its just words
clinton,1,these words i have been hearing for many years
clinton,1,i heard them when they were running for the senate in new york where hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate new york and she failed
clinton,1,i’ve heard them where hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country which are a disaster education wise job wise safety wise in every way possible
clinton,1,i’m going to help the african americans i’m going to help the latinos hispanics
clinton,1,i am going to help the inner cities
clinton,1,she has done a terrible job for the african americans
clinton,1,she wants their vote and she does nothing
clinton,1,and then she comes back four years later we saw that firsthand when she saw united states senator she campaigned where  
trump,0,how are we going to do it
trump,0,were going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes
trump,0, its just words folks
trump,0,its just words

clinton,1,finally we tonight are on the stage together donald trump and i donald its good to be with you
clinton,1,were going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country
clinton,1,you have to judge us who can shoulder the immense awesome responsibilities of the presidency who can put into action the plans that will make your life better
clinton,1,i hope that i will be able to earn your vote on november 8th
clinton,1, because roe v wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account
clinton,1,and when i voted as a senator i did not think that that was the case
clinton,1,the kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking painful decisions for families to make
clinton,1,i have met with women who have toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get
clinton,1,that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term
clinton,1,or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy
clinton,1,i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions
clinton,1,so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account
clinton,1,finally we tonight are on the stage together donald trump and i donald its good to be with you
clinton,1,were going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country
clinton,1,you have to judge us who can shoulder the immense awesome responsibilities of the presidency who can put into action the plans that will make your life better

clinton,1,i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions
clinton,1,so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account
trump,0, well i think it is terrible
trump,0,if you go with what hillary is saying in the ninth month you can take baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby
trump,0,now you can say that that is okay and hillary can say that that is okay but its not okay with me
trump,0,because based on what she is saying and based on where shes going and where shes been you can take baby and rip the baby out of the womb
trump,0,in the ninth month
trump,0,on the final day
trump,0,and thats not acceptable
trump,0, thank you lester
trump,0,our jobs are fleeing the country
trump,0,theyre going to mexico
trump,0,theyre going to many other countries
trump,0,you look at what china is doing to our country in terms of making our product
trump,0,theyre devaluing their currency and theres nobody in our government to fight them
trump,0,and we have a very good fight
trump,0,and we have a winning fight
trump,0,because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thing
trump,0, that was locker room talk
trump,0,im not proud of it
trump,0,i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for the people of this country and certainly i am not proud of it but that was something that happened
trump,0,if you look at bill clinton far worse
trump,0,mine are words and his was action
trump,0,his words what he has done to women
trump,0,there’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that has been so abusive to women
trump,0,so you can say any way you want to say it but bill clinton is abusive to women
trump,0,hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously four of them here tonight
trump,0,one of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped
trump,0,at 12
trump,0,her client she represented got him off and she is seen laughing on two occasions laughing at the girl who was raped
trump,0,kathy shelton that young woman is here with us tonight
trump,0,so dont tell me about words
trump,0,i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say but what president clinton did he was impeached he lost his license to practice law he had to pay an $850000 fine to one of the women
trump,0,paula jones who is also here tonight
trump,0,and i will tell you that when hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that i said 11 years ago i think its disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth
trump,0, well that is not what happens in these cases
trump,0,and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate
trump,0,you should meet with some of the women ive met with
trump,0,women ive known over the course of my life
trump,0,this is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make
trump,0,and i do not believe the government should be making it
trump,0,you know ive had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country
trump,0,ive been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in china or forced women to bear children like they used to do in romania
trump,0,and i can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith with medical advice
trump,0,and i will stand up for that right
trump,0, thank you lester
trump,0,our jobs are fleeing the country
trump,0,theyre going to mexico

trump,0,so were losing our good jobs so many of them
trump,0,when you look at whats happening in mexico a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world
trump,0,theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world some of the most sophisticated some of the best plants
trump,0,with the united states as he said not so much
trump,0, and honestly nobody has business doing what i just said
trump,0,doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth
trump,0,nobody has that
trump,0,so were losing our good jobs so many of them
trump,0,when you look at whats happening in mexico a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world
trump,0,theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world some of the most sophisticated some of the best plants

trump,0, and honestly nobody has business doing what i just said
trump,0,doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth
trump,0,nobody has that
trump,0,so ford is leaving
trump,0,you see that their small car division leaving
trump,0,thousands of jobs leaving michigan leaving ohio
trump,0,theyre all leaving
trump,0,and we cant allow it to happen anymore
trump,0,as far as child care is concerned and so many other things i think hillary and i agree on that
trump,0,we probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do but perhaps well be talking about that later
trump,0, well first let me start by saying that so much of what he just said is not right but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses
trump,0,he gets to decide what he wants to talk about instead of answering peoples questions talking about our agenda laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country
trump,0,thats his choice
trump,0,when i hear something like that i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all
trump,0,when they go low you go high
clinton,1,so ford is leaving
clinton,1,you see that their small car division leaving
clinton,1,thousands of jobs leaving michigan leaving ohio
clinton,1,theyre all leaving
clinton,1,and we cant allow it to happen anymore

clinton,1,thats his choice
clinton,1,when i hear something like that i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all
clinton,1,when they go low you go high
trump,0,but we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us
trump,0,we have to stop our companies from leaving the united states and with it firing all of their people
trump,0,all you have to do is take a look at carrier air conditioning in indianapolis
trump,0,they left    fired 1400 people
trump,0,theyre going to mexico
trump,0,so many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this
trump,0, applause 
clinton,1,but we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us
clinton,1,we have to stop our companies from leaving the united states and with it firing all of their people
clinton,1,all you have to do is take a look at carrier air conditioning in indianapolis
clinton,1,they left    fired 1400 people
clinton,1,theyre going to mexico
clinton,1,so many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this
clinton,1, applause 
trump,0, we cannot let it happen
trump,0,under my plan ill be reducing taxes tremendously from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies small and big businesses
trump,0,thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since ronald reagan
trump,0,its going to be a beautiful thing to watch
trump,0,and look if this were just about one video maybe what he is saying tonight would be understandable
trump,0,but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women
trump,0,but he never apologizes for anything to anyone
trump,0,he never apologized to mr and mrs khan the gold star family whose son captain khan died in the line of duty in iraq and donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion
trump,0,he never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in indiana but donald said he couldnt be trusted to be a judge because his parents were mexican
trump,0,he never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching
trump,0,and he never apologized for the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states of america
trump,0,he owes the president an apology and he owes our country an apology and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words
clinton,1, we cannot let it happen
clinton,1,under my plan ill be reducing taxes tremendously from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies small and big businesses
clinton,1,thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since ronald reagan

clinton,1,and he never apologized for the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states of america
clinton,1,he owes the president an apology and he owes our country an apology and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words
trump,0,companies will come
trump,0,they will build
trump,0,they will expand
trump,0,new companies will start
trump,0,and i look very very much forward to doing it
trump,0,we have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs
trump,0, well you owe the president an apology because as you know very well your campaign sidney blumenthal he’s another real winner that you have and he’s the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago she was saying exactly that
trump,0,so you really owe him an apology
trump,0,you’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign sent the pictures around with president obama in a certain garb that was long before i was ever involved
trump,0,so you actually owe an apology
trump,0,number two michelle obama
trump,0,i’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you and the i’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials i’ve ever seen of michelle obama talking about you hillary
trump,0,so you talk about framed go back and take a look at those commercials
trump,0,a race where you lost fair and square unlike the bernie sanders race where you won but not fair and square in my opinion and all you have to do is take a look at wikileaks and just see what they said about bernie sanders and see what debra wasserman schultz had in mind because bernie sanders between superdelegates and debra wasserman schultz he never had a chance and i was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil
trump,0,but when we talk about apology i think the one that you should really be apologizing for the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33000 e mails that you deleted and that you acid washed and the two boxes of e mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing
trump,0,and i tell you what i didnt think i would say this but im going to and i hate to say it
trump,0,but if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation
trump,0,because there has never been so many lies so much deception
trump,0,there has never been anything like it
trump,0,and we’re gonna have a special prosecutor
trump,0,when i speak i go out and speak the people of this country are furious
trump,0,in my opinion the people that have been long time workers at the fbi are furious
trump,0,there has never been anything like this where e mails and you get a subpoena
trump,0,you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33000 e mails and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say
trump,0,very expensive process
trump,0,so we’re gonna get a special prosecutor and we’re gonna look into it
trump,0,because you know what people have been    their lives have been destroyed for doing 1 5 of what you have done
trump,0,and it’s a disgrace and honestly you oughta be ashamed of yourself
trump,0, well as he was talking i was thinking about a young girl i met here in las vegas carla who is very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country but they were not
trump,0,they work hard
trump,0,they do everything they can to give her a good life
trump,0,and youre right
trump,0,i dont want to rip families apart
trump,0,i dont want to be sending families away from children
trump,0,i dont want to see the deportation force that donald has talked about in action in our country
trump,0,we have 11 million undocumented people
trump,0,they have 4 million american citizen children
trump,0,15 million people
trump,0,he said as recently as a few weeks ago in phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation
trump,0,heres with a that means
trump,0,it means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence where law enforcement officers would be going school to school home to home business to business
trump,0,rounding up people who are undocumented
trump,0,and we would then to have put them on trains on buses to get them out of our country
trump,0,i think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation
trump,0,i think it is an idea that would rip our country apart
trump,0,i have been for border security for years
trump,0,i voted for border security in the united states senate
trump,0,and my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security
trump,0,but i want to put our resources where i think theyre most needed
trump,0,getting rid of any violent person anybody who should be deported we should deport them
trump,0,when it comes to the wall that donald talks about building
trump,0,he went to mexico
trump,0,had a meeting with the mexican president
trump,0,he didnt even raise it
trump,0,he choked
trump,0,and then got into a twitter war because the mexican president said were not paying for that wall
trump,0,so i think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly
trump,0,and thats why im introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship
trump,0,companies will come
trump,0,they will build
trump,0,they will expand
trump,0,new companies will start
trump,0,and i look very very much forward to doing it
trump,0,we have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs
trump,0, well you owe the president an apology because as you know very well your campaign sidney blumenthal he’s another real winner that you have and he’s the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago she was saying exactly that

trump,0,a race where you lost fair and square unlike the bernie sanders race where you won but not fair and square in my opinion and all you have to do is take a look at wikileaks and just see what they said about bernie sanders and see what debra wasserman schultz had in mind because bernie sanders between superdelegates and debra wasserman schultz he never had a chance and i was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil
trump,0,but when we talk about apology i think the one that you should really be apologizing for the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33000 e mails that you deleted and that you acid washed and the two boxes of e mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing
trump,0,and i tell you what i didnt think i would say this but im going to and i hate to say it
trump,0,but if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation
trump,0,because there has never been so many lies so much deception
trump,0,there has never been anything like it
trump,0,and we’re gonna have a special prosecutor
trump,0,when i speak i go out and speak the people of this country are furious
trump,0,in my opinion the people that have been long time workers at the fbi are furious
trump,0,there has never been anything like this where e mails and you get a subpoena
trump,0,you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33000 e mails and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say
trump,0,very expensive process
trump,0,so we’re gonna get a special prosecutor and we’re gonna look into it
trump,0,because you know what people have been    their lives have been destroyed for doing 1 5 of what you have done
trump,0,and it’s a disgrace and honestly you oughta be ashamed of yourself
trump,0, well as he was talking i was thinking about a young girl i met here in las vegas carla who is very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country but they were not
trump,0,they work hard
trump,0,they do everything they can to give her a good life
trump,0,and youre right
trump,0,i dont want to rip families apart
trump,0,i dont want to be sending families away from children
trump,0,i dont want to see the deportation force that donald has talked about in action in our country
trump,0,we have 11 million undocumented people
trump,0,they have 4 million american citizen children
trump,0,15 million people
trump,0,he said as recently as a few weeks ago in phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation
trump,0,heres with a that means
trump,0,it means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence where law enforcement officers would be going school to school home to home business to business
trump,0,rounding up people who are undocumented
trump,0,and we would then to have put them on trains on buses to get them out of our country
trump,0,i think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation
trump,0,i think it is an idea that would rip our country apart
trump,0,i have been for border security for years
trump,0,i voted for border security in the united states senate
trump,0,and my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security
trump,0,but i want to put our resources where i think theyre most needed
trump,0,getting rid of any violent person anybody who should be deported we should deport them
trump,0,when it comes to the wall that donald talks about building
trump,0,he went to mexico
trump,0,had a meeting with the mexican president
trump,0,he didnt even raise it
trump,0,he choked
trump,0,and then got into a twitter war because the mexican president said were not paying for that wall
trump,0,so i think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly
trump,0,and thats why im introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship
clinton,1,companies will come
clinton,1,they will build
clinton,1,they will expand
clinton,1,new companies will start
clinton,1,and i look very very much forward to doing it
clinton,1,we have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs
clinton,1, well you owe the president an apology because as you know very well your campaign sidney blumenthal he’s another real winner that you have and he’s the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago she was saying exactly that
clinton,1,so you really owe him an apology
clinton,1,you’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign sent the pictures around with president obama in a certain garb that was long before i was ever involved
clinton,1,so you actually owe an apology
clinton,1,number two michelle obama
clinton,1,i’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you and the i’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials i’ve ever seen of michelle obama talking about you hillary
clinton,1,so you talk about framed go back and take a look at those commercials

clinton,1,of course we are 5 percent of the worlds population we have to trade with the other 95 percent
clinton,1,and we need to have smart fair trade deals
clinton,1, everything he just said is absolutely false but i’m not surprised

clinton,1,i would never get to talk about anything i’d want to do and how we’re really going to really make lives better for people
clinton,1,so once again go to hillaryclintoncom
clinton,1,we have literally trump   you can fact check him in real time

clinton,1,we also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions
clinton,1,and the kind of plan that donald has put forth would be trickle down economics all over again
clinton,1,in fact it would be the most extreme version the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than weve ever had
clinton,1, because you would be in jail
trump,0,we also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions

clinton,1,i call it trumped up trickle down because thats exactly what it would be
clinton,1,that is not how we grow the economy
clinton,1, we are a country of laws
clinton,1,by the way   
trump,0,i call it trumped up trickle down because thats exactly what it would be
trump,0,that is not how we grow the economy
trump,0, we are a country of laws
trump,0,by the way   
clinton,1,we just have a different view about whats best for growing the economy how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes
clinton,1,i think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives
clinton,1,i understand that
clinton,1,you know donald was very fortunate in his life and thats all to his benefit
clinton,1,he started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off well be and that everything will work out from there
clinton,1, i voted for border security and 
clinton,1,i think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives

clinton,1, i voted for border security and 
clinton,1,i dont buy that
clinton,1,i have a different experience
clinton,1,my father was a small businessman
clinton,1,he worked really hard
clinton,1,he printed drapery fabrics on long tables where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going
clinton,1, and yet she didnt know the word the letter c on a document
clinton,1,right
clinton,1,she didnt even know what that letter meant
clinton,1,you know its amazing
clinton,1,im watching hillary go over facts and she is going after fact after fact and she’s lying again because she said she you know what she did with e mails was fine
clinton,1,you think it was fine to delete 33000 e mails
clinton,1,i dont think so
clinton,1,she said that 33000 e mails had to do with her daughters wedding number one and a yoga class
clinton,1,well maybe we will give three or three or four or five or something
clinton,1,33000 e mails deleted and now she’s saying there wasn’t anything wrong
clinton,1,and more importantly that was after getting a subpoena
clinton,1,that wasn’t before
clinton,1,that was after
clinton,1,she got it from the united states congress and i will be honest
clinton,1,i am so disappointed in congressmen including republicans for allowing this to happen
clinton,1,our justice department where her husband goes on to the back of an airplane for 39 minutes talks to the attorney general days before a ruling has to be made on her case
clinton,1,but for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39000 e mails again you should be ashamed of yourself
clinton,1,what you did now this was after getting a subpoena from the united states congress  
clinton,1, and a wall
trump,0,i dont buy that
trump,0,i have a different experience

clinton,1,and so what i believe is the more we can do for the middle class the more we can invest in you your education your skills your future the better we will be off and the better well grow
clinton,1,thats the kind of economy i want us to see again
clinton,1,  there are some limited places where that was appropriate
clinton,1,there also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that
clinton,1,but it is clear when you look at what donald has been proposing
clinton,1,he started his campaign bashing immigrants calling mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers that he has a very different there view about what we should do to deal with immigrants
clinton,1,now what i am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows putting them into the formal economy would be good
clinton,1,because then employers cant exploit them and undercut americans wages
clinton,1,and donald knows a lot about this
clinton,1,he used undocumented labor to build the trump tower
clinton,1,he underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do
clinton,1,you complain ill get you deported
clinton,1,i want to get everybody out of the shadows
clinton,1,get the economy working and not let employers like donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts american workers
clinton,1,and so what i believe is the more we can do for the middle class the more we can invest in you your education your skills your future the better we will be off and the better well grow
clinton,1,thats the kind of economy i want us to see again

trump,0, hold on wait a minute if a member of the private sector did that they’d be in jail
trump,0,let alone after getting a subpoena from the united states congress
trump,0, president obama has moved millions of people out
trump,0,nobody knows about it
trump,0,nobody talks about it
trump,0,but under obama millions of people have been moved out of this country
trump,0,theyve been deported
trump,0,she doesnt want to say that but thats what has happened and that’s what happened   big league
trump,0,as far as moving these people out and moving we either have a country or we dont
trump,0,were a country of laws
trump,0,we either have a border or we dont
trump,0,now you can come back in and you can become a citizen
trump,0,but it’s very unfair
trump,0,we have millions of people that did it the right way
trump,0,theyre on line
trump,0,theyre waiting
trump,0,were going to speed up the process bigly because it’s very inefficient
trump,0,but theyre on line and they’re waiting to become citizens
trump,0,very unfair that somebody runs across the border becomes a citizen
trump,0,under her plan you have open borders
trump,0,you would have a disaster on trade and and you will have a disaster with your open borders
trump,0,what she doesn’t say is that president obama has deported millions and millions of people
trump,0, hold on wait a minute if a member of the private sector did that they’d be in jail

trump,0,you would have a disaster on trade and and you will have a disaster with your open borders
trump,0,what she doesn’t say is that president obama has deported millions and millions of people
trump,0, well for one thing    and before we start on that    my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company thats worth many many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world and i say that only because thats the kind of thinking that our country needs
trump,0,our countrys in deep trouble

trump,0,and lester theyre taking our jobs theyre giving incentives theyre doing things that frankly we dont do
trump,0, you didnt delete them
trump,0,let me give you the example of mexico
trump,0,they have a vat tax
trump,0,were on a different system
trump,0,when we sell into mexico theres a tax
trump,0,when they sell in    automatic 16 percent approximately
trump,0,when they sell into us theres no tax
trump,0,its a defective agreement
trump,0,its been defective for a long time many years but the politicians havent done anything about it
trump,0, they were personal e mails and not official
trump,0,we turned over 35000
trump,0, to sign immigration reform and george w bush supported it as well

clinton,1,its a defective agreement
clinton,1,its been defective for a long time many years but the politicians havent done anything about it
clinton,1, they were personal e mails and not official
clinton,1,we turned over 35000
clinton,1, to sign immigration reform and george w bush supported it as well
trump,0,now in all fairness to secretary clinton    yes is that ok
trump,0,good
trump,0,i want you to be very happy
trump,0,its very important to me
trump,0, what are about the other 15000
trump,0,now in all fairness to secretary clinton    yes is that ok
trump,0,good
trump,0,i want you to be very happy
trump,0,its very important to me
trump,0, what are about the other 15000
trump,0,but in all fairness to secretary clinton when she started talking about this it was really very recently
trump,0,shes been doing this for 30 years
trump,0,and why hasnt she made the agreements better
trump,0,the nafta agreement is defective
trump,0,just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the fact
trump,0, thank you
trump,0,but in all fairness to secretary clinton when she started talking about this it was really very recently
trump,0,shes been doing this for 30 years
trump,0,and why hasnt she made the agreements better
trump,0,the nafta agreement is defective
trump,0,just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the fact
trump,0, thank you
clinton,1, yes thats true
clinton,1,i didnt
trump,0, secretary clinton and others politicians should have been doing this for years not right now because of the fact that weve created a movement
trump,0,they should have been doing this for years
trump,0,whats happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is    look we owe $20 trillion
trump,0,we cannot do it any longer lester
trump,0, because you had nothing to say
trump,0, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence i was talking about energy
trump,0,we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined
trump,0,and i do want us to have an electric grid an energy system that crosses borders
trump,0,i think that would be a great benefit to us
trump,0,but you are very clearly quoting from wikileaks
trump,0,what is really important about wikileaks is that the russian government has engaged in espionage against americans
trump,0,they have hacked american websites american accounts of private people of institutions
trump,0,then they have given that information to wikileaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet
trump,0,this has come from the highest levels of the russian government
trump,0,clearly from putin himself in an effort as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election
trump,0,so i actually think the most important question of this evening chris is finally will donald trump admit and condemn that the russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of putin in this election
trump,0,that he rejects russian espionage against americans which he actually encouraged in the past
trump,0,those are the questions we need answered
trump,0,weve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before
trump,0, secretary clinton and others politicians should have been doing this for years not right now because of the fact that weve created a movement

clinton,1, well lets stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago
clinton,1,we had the worst financial crisis the great recession the worst since the 1930s
clinton,1,that was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class took their eyes off of wall street and created a perfect storm
clinton,1, let’s get to the issues that people care about tonight
clinton,1,lets get to their question
clinton,1, well thats because he would rather have a puppet as president of the united states

clinton,1,lets get to their question
clinton,1, well thats because he would rather have a puppet as president of the united states
clinton,1,in fact donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis
clinton,1,he said back in 2006 gee i hope it does collapse because then i can go in and buy some and make some money
clinton,1,well it did collapse
clinton,1, no puppet
clinton,1,youre the puppet

trump,0,that you encouraged espionage against our people
trump,0,that you are willing to spout the putin line sign up for his wish list break up nato do whatever he wants to do
trump,0,and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race
trump,0,so i think that this is such an unprecedented situation
trump,0,weve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election
trump,0,we have 17 17 intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyber attacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin
trump,0,and they are designed to influence our election

clinton,1, nine million people    nine million people lost their jobs
clinton,1,five million people lost their homes
clinton,1,and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out
clinton,1,now we have come back from that abyss
clinton,1,and it has not been easy
clinton,1,so were now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place
clinton,1, no it hasn’t it hasn’t and it hasnt been finished at all

clinton,1,independent experts have looked at what ive proposed and looked at what donalds proposed and basically theyve said this that if his tax plan which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle class families compared to the wealthy were to go into effect we would lose 35 million jobs and maybe have another recession
clinton,1, she has no idea whether it is russia china or anybody else

trump,0,no go ahead donald
trump,0, our country has no idea
clinton,1, and i think its important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad
clinton,1,and heres what we can do
clinton,1,we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels
clinton,1,we can have enough clean energy to power every home
clinton,1,we can build a new modern electric grid
clinton,1,thats a lot of jobs thats a lot of new economic activity
clinton,1, no im a gentlemen hillary
clinton,1,go ahead
clinton,1, our military and civilian

clinton,1, no im a gentlemen hillary
clinton,1,go ahead
clinton,1, our military and civilian  
clinton,1,so ive tried to be very specific about what we can and should do and i am determined that were going to get the economy really moving again building on the progress weve made over the last eight years but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place
clinton,1, yeah i doubt it i doubt it
trump,0,so ive tried to be very specific about what we can and should do and i am determined that were going to get the economy really moving again building on the progress weve made over the last eight years but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place
trump,0, yeah i doubt it i doubt it
clinton,1, i think donald was about to say he’s gonna solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the affordable care act
clinton,1,and im going to fix it because i agree with you
clinton,1,premiums have gotten too high copays deductibles prescription drug costs and i have laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down
clinton,1,but heres what i dont want people to forget when we’re talking about reigning in the cost that has to be the highest priority of the next president
clinton,1,when the affordable care act passed it wasnt just that 20 million people got insurance who didnt have it before
clinton,1,but that in and of itself is a good thing
clinton,1,i meet these people all the time and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families
clinton,1,but everybody else the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits
clinton,1,number one insurance companies cant deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition
clinton,1,number two no lifetime limits which is a big deal if you have serious health problems
clinton,1,number three women cant be charged more than men for our health insurance which is the way it used to be before the affordable care act
clinton,1,number four if you are under 26 and your parents have a policy you can be on that policy until the age of 26 something that didnt happen before
clinton,1,so i want very much to save what works and is good about the affordable care act
clinton,1,but we’ve got to get costs down we’ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance
clinton,1,but if we repeal it as donald has proposed and start over again all of those benefits i mentioned are lost to everybody
clinton,1,not just people who get health insurance on the exchange
clinton,1,and then we would have to start all over again
clinton,1,right now we are at 90% health insurance coverage
clinton,1,thats the highest we have ever been in our country
clinton,1,i want to get to 100% and get cost down and quality up
clinton,1, he would rather believe vladimir putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us
clinton,1,i find that just absolutely

trump,0, she talks about solar panels
trump,0,we invested in a solar company our country
trump,0,that was a disaster
trump,0,they lost plenty of money on that one
trump,0, she doesnt like putin because putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way
trump,0, she talks about solar panels
trump,0,we invested in a solar company our country
trump,0,that was a disaster
trump,0,they lost plenty of money on that one
trump,0, she doesnt like putin because putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way
trump,0,now look im a great believer in all forms of energy but were putting a lot of people out of work
trump,0,our energy policies are a disaster
trump,0,our country is losing so much in terms of energy in terms of paying off our debt
trump,0,you cant do what youre looking to do with $20 trillion in debt
trump,0, it is such a great question and it’s maybe the question i get almost more than anything else
trump,0,outside of defense
trump,0,obamacare is a disaster
trump,0,you know it we all know it
trump,0,its going up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen worldwide
trump,0,it’s nobody has ever seen numbers like this for health care
trump,0,its only getting worse
trump,0,in 17 it implodes by itself
trump,0,their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more money
trump,0,more more money and we have right now almost $20 trillion in debt
trump,0,obamacare will never work
trump,0,it’s very bad very bad health insurance far too expensive and not only expensive for the person that has it unbelievably expensive for our country
trump,0,it’s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly
trump,0,we have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive
trump,0,and something that works where your plan can actually be tailored
trump,0,we have to get rid of the lines around the state artificial lines where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing because they wanted president obama and whoever was working on it they want to leave those lines because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies
trump,0,we want competition
trump,0,you will have the finest health care plan there is
trump,0,she wants to go to a single player plan which would be a disaster
trump,0,somewhat similar to canada
trump,0,if you ever noticed the canadians when they need a big operation when something happens they come into the united states in many cases
trump,0,because their system is so slow its catastrophic in certain ways
trump,0,but she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything
trump,0,hillary clinton has been after this for years
trump,0,obamacare was the first step obamacare is a total disaster and not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody’s ever believed but your deductibles are going up
trump,0,so that unless you get hit by a truck you will never be able to use it
trump,0,its a disastrous plan and it has to be repealed and replaced
trump,0,now look im a great believer in all forms of energy but were putting a lot of people out of work

trump,0,its a disastrous plan and it has to be repealed and replaced
trump,0,the obama administration from the time theyve come in is over 230 years worth of debt and hes topped it
trump,0,hes doubled it in a course of almost eight years seven and a half years to be semi  exact
trump,0, excuse me
trump,0,putin has outsmarted her in syria he’s outsmarted her every step of the way
trump,0,the obama administration from the time theyve come in is over 230 years worth of debt and hes topped it
trump,0,hes doubled it in a course of almost eight years seven and a half years to be semi  exact
trump,0, excuse me
trump,0,putin has outsmarted her in syria he’s outsmarted her every step of the way
trump,0,so i will tell you this
trump,0,we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs
trump,0,and we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand because theyre not doing it
trump,0, no
trump,0,i mean he clarified what he meant and it’s very clear
trump,0,look we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again we might come up with a different system
trump,0,but we have an employer based system that’s where the vast majority of people get their health care
trump,0,and the affordable care act is meant to try to fill the gap between people who are too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford healthcare namely people on medicaid
trump,0,obviously medicare which is a single payer system which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it by the way and then all the people who were employed but people who were working but didnt have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody an employer or anybody else to help them
trump,0,that was the slot that the obamacare approach was to take
trump,0,and like i say 20 million people now have health insurance
trump,0,so if we rip it up and throw it away what donald is not telling you is we turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be
trump,0,and that means that insurance companies get to do pretty much whatever they want including saying look im sorry you have diabetes you had cancer  
clinton,1,so i will tell you this
clinton,1,we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs
clinton,1,and we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand because theyre not doing it

clinton,1,  million new jobs a balanced budget
clinton,1, excuse me
clinton,1,president obama by keeping those lines the boundary lines around each state and it was almost done until just towards the end of the passage of obamacare
clinton,1,which by the way was a fraud
clinton,1,you know that
clinton,1,because jonathan grouper the architect of obamacare was said he said it was a great lie it was a big lie
clinton,1,president obama said you keep your doctor keep your plan
clinton,1,the whole thing was a fraud and it doesnt work
clinton,1,but when we get rid of those lines you have competition and we will be able to keep preexisting we’ll also be able to help people that cant get dont have money because we are going to have people protected
clinton,1,and republicans feel this way
clinton,1,believe it or not we’re going to block grant into the states we’re going to block grant into medicaid so we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to cake care of themselves
clinton,1, he has advocated more countries getting them
clinton,1,japan korea even saudi arabia
clinton,1,he’s said if we have them why dont we use them which i think is terrifying
clinton,1,but heres the deal
clinton,1,the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it must be followed
clinton,1,there is about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so
clinton,1,and that is why ten people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and in an unprecedented way said they would not trust donald trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button
trump,0,  million new jobs a balanced budget
trump,0, excuse me

trump,0, he approved nafta which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, i have 200 generals and admirals 21 endorsing me
trump,0,21 congressional medal of honor recipients
trump,0,as far as japan and other countries we are being ripped off by everybody in the world
trump,0,were defending other countries
trump,0,we are spending a fortune doing it
trump,0,they have the bargain of the century
trump,0,all i said is we have to renegotiate these agreements
trump,0,because our country cannot afford to defend saudi arabia japan germany south korea and many other places
trump,0,we cannot continue to afford
trump,0,she took that as saying nuclear weapons
trump,0, he approved nafta which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country

clinton,1, incomes went up for everybody
clinton,1,manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s if were actually going to look at the facts
clinton,1,when i was in the senate i had a number of trade deals that came before me and i held them all to the same test
clinton,1,will they create jobs in america
clinton,1,will they raise incomes in america
clinton,1,and are they good for our national security
clinton,1,some of them i voted for
clinton,1,the biggest one a multinational one known as cafta i voted against
clinton,1,and because i hold the same standards as i look at all of these trade deals
clinton,1, look
clinton,1,shes been proven to be a liar on so many different ways
clinton,1,this is just another lie
trump,0,when i was in the senate i had a number of trade deals that came before me and i held them all to the same test
trump,0,will they create jobs in america
trump,0,will they raise incomes in america
trump,0,and are they good for our national security
trump,0,some of them i voted for

trump,0, look
trump,0,shes been proven to be a liar on so many different ways
trump,0,this is just another lie
clinton,1,but lets not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy
clinton,1,i think it is a part of it and ive said what im going to do
clinton,1,im going to have a special prosecutor
clinton,1,were going to enforce the trade deals we have and were going to hold people accountable
clinton,1, well im just quoting you when 
clinton,1,but lets not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy
clinton,1,i think it is a part of it and ive said what im going to do
clinton,1,im going to have a special prosecutor
clinton,1,were going to enforce the trade deals we have and were going to hold people accountable
clinton,1, well im just quoting you when 
clinton,1,when i was secretary of state we actually increased american exports globally 30 percent
clinton,1,we increased them to china 50 percent
clinton,1,so i know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs
clinton,1, you are right about islamophobia and thats a shame
clinton,1,but one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that because there is a problem
clinton,1,i mean whether we like it or not and we can be politically correct but whether we like it or not there is a problem
clinton,1,and we have to be sure that muslims come in and report when they see something going on
clinton,1,when they see hatred going on they have to report it
clinton,1,as the example in san bernardino
clinton,1,many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many many people
clinton,1,horribly wounded they will never be the same
clinton,1,muslims have to report the problems when they see them
clinton,1,and you know there is always a reason for everything
clinton,1,if they dont do that its a very difficult situation for our country
clinton,1,because you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center
clinton,1,go outside and you look at paris look at that horrible thing
clinton,1,these are radical islamic terrorists and she wont even mention the word and nor will president obama
clinton,1,he wont use the term radical islamic terrorist no
clinton,1,to solve a problem you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name
clinton,1,she wont say the name and president obama wont say the name
clinton,1,but the name is there
clinton,1,its radical islamic terror
clinton,1,and before you solve it you have to say the name
clinton,1, there is no quote
clinton,1,you wont find a quote from me
trump,0,when i was secretary of state we actually increased american exports globally 30 percent

clinton,1, nuclear competition in asia
clinton,1,you said go ahead
clinton,1,enjoy yourselves folks
trump,0, but you havent done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to
trump,0, thank you for asking your question and i’ve heard this question from a lot of muslim americans across our country
trump,0,because unfortunately there has been a lot of very divise dark things said about muslims
trump,0,and even someone like captain khan the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the united states army has been subject to attack by donald
trump,0,i want to say just a couple of things
trump,0,first we’ve had muslims in america since george washington
trump,0,and we’ve had many successful muslims
trump,0,we just lost a particularly well known one with muhammad ali
trump,0,my vision of america is an america where everyone has a place if you are willing to work hard do your part and you contribute to the community
trump,0,thats what america is
trump,0,thats what we want america to be for our children and our grandchildren
trump,0,its also very short sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that donald has about muslims
trump,0,we need american muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lawns
trump,0,i’ve worked with a lot of muslim groups around america
trump,0,i’ve met with a lot of them and i’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country
trump,0,part of our homeland security
trump,0,and thats what i want to see
trump,0,its also important i intend to defeat isisto do so in a coalition with majority muslim nations
trump,0,right now a lot of those nations are hearing what donald says and wondering why should we cooperate with the americans and this is a gift to isis and the terrorists
trump,0,violent jihadist terrorists
trump,0,we are not at war with islam and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are

trump,0, and defend yourselves
trump,0,and defend yourselves
trump,0,i didnt say    and defend yourself
clinton,1, but you havent done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to
clinton,1, thank you for asking your question and i’ve heard this question from a lot of muslim americans across our country
clinton,1,because unfortunately there has been a lot of very divise dark things said about muslims
clinton,1,and even someone like captain khan the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the united states army has been subject to attack by donald
clinton,1,i want to say just a couple of things
clinton,1,first we’ve had muslims in america since george washington
clinton,1,and we’ve had many successful muslims
clinton,1,we just lost a particularly well known one with muhammad ali
clinton,1,my vision of america is an america where everyone has a place if you are willing to work hard do your part and you contribute to the community
clinton,1,thats what america is

clinton,1, well ive been a senator donald
clinton,1, the united states has kept the peace through our alliances
clinton,1,donald wants to tear up our alliances
clinton,1,i think it makes the world safer and frankly it makes the united states safer
clinton,1,i would work with our allies in asia in europe in the middle east and elsewhere
clinton,1,that is the only way

trump,0, you havent done it
trump,0,you havent done it
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, first of all captain khan is an american hero and if i were president at that time he would be alive today because unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing i would not have had our people in iraq
trump,0,iraq was a disaster
trump,0,so he would have been alive today
trump,0,the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world
trump,0,hillary clinton wants to allow   
trump,0, you havent done it

trump,0,hillary clinton wants to allow   
clinton,1, and i have been a secretary of state
clinton,1, well i think the middle class thrives america thrives
clinton,1,so my plan is based on growing the economy giving middle class families many more opportunities
clinton,1,i want us to have the biggest jobs program since world war ii
clinton,1,jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing
clinton,1,i think we can compete with high wage countries and i believe we should
clinton,1,new jobs in clean energy
clinton,1,not only to fight climate change which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses
clinton,1,i want us to do more to help small business that’s where two thirds of the new jobs are going to come from
clinton,1,i want to us raise the national minimum wage because people who work full time should not still be in poverty
clinton,1,and i sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do
clinton,1,i feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college
clinton,1,that’s why i want more technical education and community colleges real apprenticeships to prepare young peel for the jobs of the future
clinton,1,i want to make college debt free and for families making less than $125000 you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or a university if the plan that i worked on with bernie sanders is enacted
clinton,1,and were going to work hard to make sure that it is
clinton,1,because we are going to go where the money is
clinton,1,most of the gains in the last years since the great recession have gone to the very top
clinton,1,so we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share
clinton,1,were going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country
clinton,1,that is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs
clinton,1,by contrast donalds plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 35 million jobs
clinton,1,why
clinton,1,because his whole plan is to cut taxes
clinton,1,to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations
clinton,1,adding $20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before
clinton,1,because it truly will be trickle down economics on steroids
clinton,1,so the plan i have i think will actually produce greater opportunities
clinton,1,the plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another great recession
clinton,1, and i have been a secretary of state
clinton,1, well i think the middle class thrives america thrives

trump,0, excuse me
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, it is called extreme vetting
trump,0,we are going to areas like syria where they are coming in by the tens of thousands because of barack obama and hillary clinton wants wants to allow a 550% increase over obama
trump,0,people are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are where they are from what their feelings about our country is and she wants 550% more
trump,0,this is going to be the great trojan horse of all time
trump,0,we have enough problems in this country
trump,0,i believe in building safe zone i believe in having other people pay for them as an example the arabian gulf states who are not carrying their weight but they have nothing but money and take care of people
trump,0,but i dont want to have with all the problems this country has and all of the problems you see going on hundreds of thousands of people come in from syria where we know nothing about them
trump,0,we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country
trump,0, excuse me

trump,0,we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country
clinton,1, and i have done a lot
clinton,1, well first of all before i start on my plan her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes
clinton,1,her tax plan is a disaster
clinton,1,and she can say all she wants about college tuition
clinton,1,and im a big proponent
clinton,1,were going to do a lot of things for college tuition but the rest the public is going to be paying for it
clinton,1,we will have a massive massive tax increase under hillary clintons plan
clinton,1,but i would like to start off where we left
clinton,1,because when i said japan and germany and im not just singling them out
clinton,1,but south korea these are very rich countries
clinton,1,saudi arabia
clinton,1,nothing but money
clinton,1,we protect saudi arabia
clinton,1,why arent they paying
clinton,1,she immediately when she heard this i questioned it and i questioned nato why aren’t they nato questioned
clinton,1,why arent they paying
clinton,1,because they weren’t paying
clinton,1,since i did this this was a year ago
clinton,1,all of a sudden theyre paying
clinton,1,and ive been given a lot of credit for it
clinton,1,all of a sudden theyre starting to pay up
clinton,1,they have to pay up
clinton,1,were protecting people
clinton,1,they have to pay up
clinton,1,and im a big fan of nato but they have to pay up
clinton,1,she comes out and says “we love our allies
clinton,1,we think our allies are great” well it is awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are
clinton,1,we have to tell japan in a very nice way we have to tell germany all of these countries south korea
clinton,1,we have to say you have to help us out
clinton,1,we have during his regime during president obamas regime weve doubled our national debt
clinton,1,were up to $20 trillion
clinton,1,so my plan we’re going to negotiate trade deals
clinton,1,we’re going to have a lot of free trade
clinton,1,more free trade than we have right now
clinton,1,but we have horrible deals
clinton,1,our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed
clinton,1,nafta
clinton,1,one of the worst deals ever
clinton,1,the jobs are being sucked out of our economy
clinton,1,you look at the places i just left
clinton,1,you go to pennsylvania you go to ohio you go to florida you go to any of them
clinton,1,you go to upstate new york
clinton,1,our jobs have fled to mexico and other places
clinton,1,were bringing our jobs back
clinton,1,im going to renegotiate nafta
clinton,1,and if i cant make a great deal then were going to terminate nafta and we’re going to create new deals
clinton,1,were going to have trade but were going to terminate it
clinton,1,were going on make a great trade deal
clinton,1,if we cant were going to go our separate way because it has been a disaster
clinton,1,were going to cut taxes massively
clinton,1,were going to cut business taxes massively
clinton,1,theyre going to start hiring people were going to bring the $25 trillion that’s offshore back into the country
clinton,1,we are going to start the engine rolling again because right now our country is dying
clinton,1,at 1% gdp
trump,0, and i have done a lot

trump,0, your husband signed nafta which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry
trump,0, first of all i will not let anyone into our country that i think poses a risk to us
trump,0,but there are a lot of refugees women and children think of that picture we all saw of that 4 year old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the russian and syrian air forces
trump,0,there are children suffering in this catastrophic war largely i believe because of russian aggression
trump,0,and we need to do our part
trump,0,we by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that europe and others are
trump,0,but we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals our intelligence experts and others
trump,0,but it is important for us as a policy not to say as donald has said we’re going to ban people based on a religion
trump,0,how do you that
trump,0,we are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty
trump,0,how do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own country
trump,0,are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country and how do we expect to be able to implement those
trump,0,so i thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous and indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites and what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters
trump,0,because they want to create a war between us
trump,0,and the final thing i say this is the 10th or 12th time he denied being for the war in iraq
trump,0,we have it on tape the entire press corps has looked at it it’s been debunked but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say

trump,0,nafta is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere but certainly ever signed in this country
trump,0, go to hillaryclintoncom and you can see it
trump,0, the fact is he is going to advocate for the largest tax cuts weve ever seen
trump,0,three times more than the tax cuts under the bush administration
trump,0,i have said repeatedly throughout this campaign i will not raise taxes on anyone making $250000 or less
trump,0,i also will not add a penny to the debt
trump,0,i have costed out what i’m going to do
trump,0,he will through his massive tax cuts add $20 trillion to the debt
trump,0,he mentioned the debt
trump,0,we know how to get control of the debt
trump,0,when my husband was president we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt
trump,0,when president obama came into office he inherited the worst economic disaster since the great depression
trump,0,he has cut the deficit by two thirds
trump,0,so yes one of the ways you go after the debt one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people

clinton,1,when my husband was president we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt
clinton,1,when president obama came into office he inherited the worst economic disaster since the great depression
clinton,1,he has cut the deficit by two thirds
clinton,1,so yes one of the ways you go after the debt one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people
clinton,1,so i do have investments
clinton,1,investments in new jobs investments in education skill training and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead
clinton,1,thats the kind of approach  
trump,0,and now you want to approve trans pacific partnership
trump,0,you were totally in favor of it
trump,0,then you heard what i was saying how bad it is and you said i cant win that debate
trump,0,but you know that if you did win you would approve that and that will be almost as bad as nafta
trump,0,nothing will ever top nafta
trump,0, it has not been debunked and you voted for it and shouldnt have
trump,0,and now you want to approve trans pacific partnership
trump,0,you were totally in favor of it
trump,0,then you heard what i was saying how bad it is and you said i cant win that debate
trump,0,but you know that if you did win you would approve that and that will be almost as bad as nafta
trump,0,nothing will ever top nafta
trump,0, it has not been debunked and you voted for it and shouldnt have
clinton,1, well that is just not accurate
clinton,1,i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out
clinton,1,i wrote about that in
clinton,1,    that will work
clinton,1,cutting taxes on the wealthy
clinton,1,weve tried that
clinton,1,it has not worked the way that it has been   
clinton,1, well that is just not accurate
clinton,1,i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out
clinton,1,i wrote about that in
clinton,1,    that will work

clinton,1,weve tried that
clinton,1,it has not worked the way that it has been   
trump,0, you called it the gold standard
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, excuse me she just went about 25 seconds over her time

trump,0, you called it the gold standard
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, excuse me she just went about 25 seconds over her time

trump,0, you called it the gold standard of trade deals
trump,0,you said its the finest deal youve ever seen
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, hillary clinton in terms of having people come into our country
trump,0,we have many criminal illegal aliens
trump,0,when we want to send them back to their country their country says we dont want them
trump,0,in some cases they are murderers drug lords drug problems and they dont want them
trump,0,and hillary clinton when she was secretary of state said that’s okay we can’t force them back into their country
trump,0,let me tell you i’m going to force them right back into their country
trump,0,they are murderers and some very bad people
trump,0,and i will tell you very strongly when bernie sanders said she had bad judgment she has really bad judgement because we are letting people into this country that are gonna cause problems and crime like you’ve never seen
trump,0,we’re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip
trump,0,at a record clip
trump,0,and it shouldnt be allowed to happen
trump,0,ice just endorsed me
trump,0,they never endorsed a presidential candidate
trump,0,the border patrol agents 16500 just recently endorsed me
trump,0,and they endorsed me because i understand the border
trump,0,she doesnt
trump,0,she wants amnesty for everybody
trump,0,come right in
trump,0,come right over
trump,0,its a horrible thing she is doing
trump,0,she’s got bad judgment and honestly so bad that she should never be president of the united states
trump,0,that i can tell you
trump,0, you called it the gold standard of trade deals
trump,0,you said its the finest deal youve ever seen

trump,0,that i can tell you
clinton,1, no
clinton,1, well it is a combination chris
clinton,1,let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that president obama inherited it was a real touch and go situation
clinton,1,i was in the senate before i became secretary of state
clinton,1,ive never seen people as physically distraught as the bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy
clinton,1,i personally believe that the steps that president obama took saved the economy
clinton,1,he doesnt get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions
clinton,1, no
clinton,1, well it is a combination chris
clinton,1,let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that president obama inherited it was a real touch and go situation
clinton,1,i was in the senate before i became secretary of state

clinton,1,i personally believe that the steps that president obama took saved the economy
clinton,1,he doesnt get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions
trump,0, and then you heard what i said about it and all of a sudden you were against it
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, right
trump,0,as i recall that was something i said about abraham lincoln after having seen the wonderful steven spielberg movie called lincoln
trump,0,it was a master class watching president lincoln get the congress to approve the 13th amendment
trump,0,it was principled and it was strategic and i was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the congress to do what you want to do
trump,0,and you have to keep working at it and yes president lincoln was trying to convince some people he used some arguments convincing other people he used other arguments
trump,0,that was a great i thought a great display of presidential leadership
trump,0,but you know lets talk about whats really going on here martha because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin meaning putin and the russian government are directing the attacks the hacking on american accounts to influence our election
trump,0,and wikileaks is part of that as are other sites where the russians hack information we dont even know if its accurate information and then they put it out
trump,0,we have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary a foreign power is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election and believe they’re not doing it to get me elected
trump,0,they are doing it to try to influence the election for donald trump
trump,0,now maybe because he praised putin maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what putin wants to do maybe because he wants to do business in moscow
trump,0,i don’t know the reasons but we deserve answers and should demand that donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships  
trump,0,but it was a terrible recession
trump,0,so now weve dug ourselves out of it
trump,0,were standing but were not yet running
trump,0,so what i am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up
trump,0,not the top down
trump,0,that is not going to work
trump,0,that is why what i have put forward doesnt add a penny to the debt
trump,0,but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs higher paying jobs
trump,0,were beginning to see some increase in incomes
trump,0,and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs
trump,0,we have got to do more to get the whole economy moving and thats what i believe i will be able to do
clinton,1, and then you heard what i said about it and all of a sudden you were against it
clinton,1,interruption
clinton,1, right

clinton,1, well donald i know you live in your own reality but that is not the facts
clinton,1,the facts are    i did say i hoped it would be a good deal but when it was negotiated
trump,0, not
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, i think i should respond because so ridiculous
trump,0,look now she is blaming    she got caught in a total lie
trump,0,her papers went out to all her friends at the banks goldman sachs and everybody else
trump,0,and she said things wikileaks that just came out
trump,0,and she lied
trump,0,now she’s blaming the lie on the late great abraham lincoln
trump,0,that’s when okay honest abe never lied
trump,0,that’s the good thing
trump,0,thats the big difference between abraham lincoln and you
trump,0,thats a big big difference
trump,0,we’re talking about some difference
trump,0,but as far as other elements of what you were saying i dont know putin
trump,0,i think it would be great if we got along with russia because we could fight isis together as an example but i dont know putin
trump,0,but i notice any time anything wrong happens they like to say the russians well she doesnt know if its the russians doing the hacking
trump,0,maybe there is no hacking but there is   now russia   and the reason they blame russia is they think they’re trying to tarnish me with russia
trump,0,i know nothing about russia   i know about russia but i know nothing about the inner workings of russia
trump,0,i don’t deal there i have no businesses there i have no loans from russia
trump,0,i have a very very great balance sheet
trump,0,so great that when i did the old post office on pennsylvania avenue the united states government because of my balance sheet which they actually know very well chose me to do the old post office between the white house and congress
trump,0,they chose me to do the old post office   one of the primary things in fact perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet
trump,0,but i have no loans with russia
trump,0,you could go to the united states government and they would probably tell you that because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development i had to have   now the taxes are a very simple thing
trump,0,as soon as i have   first of all i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes
trump,0,many of her friends took bigger deductions
trump,0,warren buffett took a massive deduction soros who’s a friend of hers took a massive deduction
trump,0,many of the people that are giving her all this money so that she can do many more commercials than me gave her   took massive deductions
trump,0,i pay hundreds of millions in taxes but but as soon as my routine audit is finished i’ll release my returns
trump,0,i’ll be very proud to
trump,0, over a 10 year period
trump,0, not
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, i think i should respond because so ridiculous

trump,0, over a 10 year period
clinton,1,  which i was not responsible for i concluded it wasnt
clinton,1,i wrote about that in my book
trump,0, so is it president obamas fault
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, so i just left some high representatives of india
trump,0,theyre growing at 8%
trump,0,china is growing at 7%
trump,0,and that for them is a catastrophically low number
trump,0,we are growing our last report came out and it is right around the 1% level
trump,0,and i think it’s going down
trump,0,last week as you know the end of last week they came out with an anemic jobs report
trump,0,a terrible jobs report
trump,0,in fact i said is that the last jobs report before the election
trump,0,because if it is i should win easily because it was so bad
trump,0,the report was so bad
trump,0,look our country is stagnant
trump,0,weve lost our jobs weve lost our businesses
trump,0,were not making things anymore relatively speaking
trump,0,our product is pouring in from china pouring in from vietnam pouring in from all over the world
trump,0,ive visited so many communities
trump,0,this has been such an incredible education for me chris
trump,0,ive gotten to know so many i’ve developed so many friends over the last year
trump,0,and they cry when they see what has happened
trump,0,i pass factories that were thriving 20 25 years ago and because of the bill her husband signed and that she blessed 100%
trump,0,it is just horrible what has happened to these people in these communities
trump,0,now she can say her husband did well but boy did they suffer as nafta kicked in because it didnt really kick in very much
trump,0,but it kicked in after they left
trump,0,boy did they suffer
trump,0,that was one of the worst things that has ever been signed by our country
trump,0,now she wants to sign trans pacific partnership
trump,0,and she wants it
trump,0,she lied when she said she didnt call it the gold standard in one of the debates
trump,0,she totally lied
trump,0,she did call it the gold standard
trump,0,and they actually fact checked and they said i was right
trump,0, so is it president obamas fault
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, so i just left some high representatives of india
trump,0,theyre growing at 8%
trump,0,china is growing at 7%
trump,0,and that for them is a catastrophically low number
trump,0,we are growing our last report came out and it is right around the 1% level

trump,0,she lied when she said she didnt call it the gold standard in one of the debates
trump,0,she totally lied
trump,0,she did call it the gold standard
trump,0,and they actually fact checked and they said i was right
clinton,1,  before you even announced
trump,0, is it president obamas fault
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, and that will be as bad as nafta
trump,0, is it president obamas fault
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, and that will be as bad as nafta
trump,0, look there are differences
trump,0, one thing i’d do is get rid of carried interest
trump,0,the   one of the greatest provisions for people like me to be honest with you i give up a lot when i run because i knockout the tax code
trump,0,and she could have done this years ago by the way
trump,0,she is   she was a united states senator
trump,0,she complains that donald trump took advantage of the tax code
trump,0,well why didnt you change it why didn’t you change it when you were a senator
trump,0,the reason you didn’t is that all your friends take the same advantage that i do
trump,0,and they do you have provisions in the tax code that frankly we could change
trump,0,but you wouldnt change it because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on donald trump
trump,0,but and i say that about a lot of things
trump,0,i heard hillary complaining about so many different things over the years i wish we would have done this
trump,0,but she’s been there for 30 years she’s been doing this stuff she never changed and she never will change
trump,0,she never will change
trump,0,we are getting rid of carried interest provisions
trump,0,i’m lowering taxes actually because i think its so important for corporations because we have corporations leaving massive corporations and little ones
trump,0,the little ones cant form
trump,0,we are getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering the taxes
trump,0,but we’re bringing the tax rate down from 35% to 15%
trump,0,we are cutting taxes for the middle class and i will tell you we are cutting them big league for the middle class
trump,0,and i’ll tell you hillary clinton is raising your taxes folks she can look at me she is raising your taxes really high and what thats going to do is a disaster for the country
trump,0,but she is raising the taxes and im lowering the taxes
trump,0,that in itself is a big difference
trump,0,we are going to be thriving again
trump,0,we have no growth in this country
trump,0,there is no growth
trump,0,if china has a gdp of 7% its like a national catastrophe
trump,0,we’re down at 1% and thats like no growth
trump,0,and we are going lower in my opinion
trump,0,and a lot of that has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high
trump,0,just about the highest in the world and im bringing them down to one of the lower in the world
trump,0,and i think its so important
trump,0,one of the most important things we can do
trump,0,but she is raising everybodys taxes massively
trump,0, well first let me say number one when i saw the final agreement for tpp i said i was against it
trump,0,it didnt meet my test
trump,0,ive had the same test
trump,0,does it create jobs raise incomes and further our national security
trump,0,i’m against it now
trump,0,i’ll be against it after the election
trump,0,ill be against it when im president
trump,0,theres only one of us on this stage who has actually shipped jobs to mexico because thats donald
trump,0,he has shipped jobs to 12 countries including mexico
trump,0,but he mentioned china
trump,0,and you know one of the biggest problems we have with china is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets
trump,0,i have fought against that as a senator
trump,0,i have stood up against it as secretary of state
trump,0,donald has bought chinese steel and aluminum
trump,0,in fact the trump hotel right here in las vegas was made with chinese steel
trump,0,so he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is
trump,0,but he has given jobs to chinese steelworkers not american steelworkers
trump,0,thats the kind of approach that is just not going to work
trump,0,were going to pull the country together
trump,0,were going to have trade agreements that we enforce
trump,0,thats why im going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history
trump,0,and were going to enforce those agreements and were going to look for businesses to help us by buying american products
trump,0, look there are differences
trump,0, one thing i’d do is get rid of carried interest
trump,0,the   one of the greatest provisions for people like me to be honest with you i give up a lot when i run because i knockout the tax code
trump,0,and she could have done this years ago by the way
trump,0,she is   she was a united states senator
trump,0,she complains that donald trump took advantage of the tax code
trump,0,well why didnt you change it why didn’t you change it when you were a senator
trump,0,the reason you didn’t is that all your friends take the same advantage that i do
trump,0,and they do you have provisions in the tax code that frankly we could change
trump,0,but you wouldnt change it because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on donald trump
trump,0,but and i say that about a lot of things
trump,0,i heard hillary complaining about so many different things over the years i wish we would have done this
trump,0,but she’s been there for 30 years she’s been doing this stuff she never changed and she never will change
trump,0,she never will change
trump,0,we are getting rid of carried interest provisions
trump,0,i’m lowering taxes actually because i think its so important for corporations because we have corporations leaving massive corporations and little ones
trump,0,the little ones cant form
trump,0,we are getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering the taxes
trump,0,but we’re bringing the tax rate down from 35% to 15%
trump,0,we are cutting taxes for the middle class and i will tell you we are cutting them big league for the middle class
trump,0,and i’ll tell you hillary clinton is raising your taxes folks she can look at me she is raising your taxes really high and what thats going to do is a disaster for the country
trump,0,but she is raising the taxes and im lowering the taxes
trump,0,that in itself is a big difference
trump,0,we are going to be thriving again
trump,0,we have no growth in this country
trump,0,there is no growth
trump,0,if china has a gdp of 7% its like a national catastrophe
trump,0,we’re down at 1% and thats like no growth
trump,0,and we are going lower in my opinion
trump,0,and a lot of that has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high
trump,0,just about the highest in the world and im bringing them down to one of the lower in the world
trump,0,and i think its so important
trump,0,one of the most important things we can do
trump,0,but she is raising everybodys taxes massively
trump,0, well first let me say number one when i saw the final agreement for tpp i said i was against it
trump,0,it didnt meet my test
trump,0,ive had the same test
trump,0,does it create jobs raise incomes and further our national security
trump,0,i’m against it now
trump,0,i’ll be against it after the election
trump,0,ill be against it when im president
trump,0,theres only one of us on this stage who has actually shipped jobs to mexico because thats donald
trump,0,he has shipped jobs to 12 countries including mexico
trump,0,but he mentioned china
trump,0,and you know one of the biggest problems we have with china is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets
trump,0,i have fought against that as a senator
trump,0,i have stood up against it as secretary of state
trump,0,donald has bought chinese steel and aluminum
trump,0,in fact the trump hotel right here in las vegas was made with chinese steel
trump,0,so he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is
trump,0,but he has given jobs to chinese steelworkers not american steelworkers
trump,0,thats the kind of approach that is just not going to work
trump,0,were going to pull the country together
trump,0,were going to have trade agreements that we enforce
trump,0,thats why im going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history
trump,0,and were going to enforce those agreements and were going to look for businesses to help us by buying american products
clinton,1, look there are differences
clinton,1, one thing i’d do is get rid of carried interest
clinton,1,the   one of the greatest provisions for people like me to be honest with you i give up a lot when i run because i knockout the tax code

trump,0, secretary is it president obamas fault
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, can i ask a simple question
trump,0,shes been doing this for 30 years
trump,0,why the hell didnt you do it over the last 15 20 years
trump,0,you were very much involved
trump,0, secretary is it president obamas fault
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, can i ask a simple question
trump,0,shes been doing this for 30 years
trump,0,why the hell didnt you do it over the last 15 20 years
trump,0,you were very much involved
clinton,1, there are
clinton,1, well everything you’ve heard from donald is not true
clinton,1,im sorry i have to keep saying this but he lives in an alternative reality
clinton,1,and it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasnt paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he’s going to do but i’ll tell you what he’s going to do
clinton,1,his plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they have ever had
clinton,1,more than the bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two
clinton,1,donald always takes care of donald and people like donald
clinton,1,and this would be a massive gift
clinton,1,and indeed the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle class families
clinton,1,millions of middle class families
clinton,1,now heres what i want to do
clinton,1,i have said nobody who makes less than $250000 a year and thats the vast majority of americans as you know will have their taxes raised
clinton,1,because i think we have got to go where the money is and the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code
clinton,1,and yes when i was a senator i did vote to close corporate loopholes
clinton,1,i voted to close i think one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes
clinton,1,i want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars its called the buffett rule
clinton,1,yes warren buffett is the one who’s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary
clinton,1,i wanna have a surcharge on incomes above 5 million
clinton,1,we have to make up for lost times because i want to invest in you i want to invest in hard working families
clinton,1,and i think it has been unfortunate but its happened that since the great recession the gains have all gone to the top
clinton,1,and we need to reverse that
clinton,1,people like donald who paid zero in taxes zero for our vets zero for our military zero for health and education
clinton,1,that is wrong
clinton,1,and we’re going to make sure that nobody no corporation and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country
clinton,1, i voted   
clinton,1, there are

clinton,1, i voted   
trump,0, because hes pushing it
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, excuse me
trump,0,my turn
trump,0,you were very much involved in every aspect of this country
trump,0,very much
trump,0,and you do have experience
trump,0,i say the one thing you have over me is experience
trump,0,but it is bad experience because what youve done has turned out badly
trump,0,for 30 years youve been in a position to help
trump,0,and if you say that i used steel or i used something else i  make it impossible for me to do
trump,0,i wouldnt mind
trump,0,the problem is you talk but you dont get anything done hillary
trump,0,you dont
trump,0,just like when you ran the state department $6 billion was missing
trump,0,how do you miss $6 billion
trump,0,you ran the state department
trump,0,$6 billion was either stolen they dont know
trump,0,it’s gone
trump,0,$6 billion
trump,0,if you become president this country is going to be in some mess
trump,0,believe me
trump,0, because hes pushing it
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, excuse me
trump,0,my turn
trump,0,you were very much involved in every aspect of this country
trump,0,very much

trump,0,if you become president this country is going to be in some mess
trump,0,believe me
clinton,1, there are different views about whats good for our country our economy and our leadership in the world
clinton,1,and i think its important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again
clinton,1,thats why i said new jobs with rising incomes investments not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt
clinton,1, of course i did
clinton,1,of course i did
clinton,1,and so do all of her donors or most of her donors
clinton,1,i know many of her donors
clinton,1,her donors took massive tax write offs
clinton,1,a lot lot of my write off was depreciation and a lot of other things hillary clinton as a senator allowed and she always allowed because the people that give her all this money they want it
clinton,1,that’s why
clinton,1,see i understand the tax code better than anybody that’s ever run for president
clinton,1,hillary clinton is extremely complex
clinton,1,hillary clinton has friends that want all of these provisions including they want the carried interest provision which is very important to wall street people but they really want the carried interest provision which i believe hillary is leaving and its very interesting why she is leaving carried interest
clinton,1,but i will tell you that number one i pay tremendous numbers of taxes
clinton,1,i absolutely used it and so did warren buffett and so did george soros and so did many of the other people that hillary is getting money from
clinton,1,now i wont mention their names because they are rich but they’re not famous
clinton,1,so we won’t make them famous
clinton,1, well first of all what he just said about the state department is not only untrue it’s been debunked numerous times
clinton,1,but i think its really an important issue
clinton,1,he raised the 30 years of experience so let me just talk briefly about that
clinton,1,you know back in the 1970s i worked for the childrens defense fund and i was taking on discrimination against african american kids in schools
clinton,1,he was getting sued by the justice department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings
clinton,1,in the 1980s i was working to reform the schools in arkansas
clinton,1,he was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses
clinton,1,in the 1990s i went to beijing and i said womens rights are human rights
clinton,1,he insulted a former miss universe alicia machado and called her an eating machine
trump,0, there are different views about whats good for our country our economy and our leadership in the world
trump,0,and i think its important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again

trump,0,and if we could run our country the way ive run my company we would have a country that would you would be so proud of you would even be proud of it
trump,0,and frankly when you look at her real record take a look at syria take a look at the migration take a look at libya take a look at iraq
trump,0,she gave us isis because her and obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because we should have never been in iraq but once we were there we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out
trump,0,she gave us isis as sure as you are sitting there

clinton,1, you know under our constitution presidents have something called veto power
clinton,1,look he has now said repeatedly 30 years this and 30 years that
clinton,1,so let me talk about my 30 years in public service

clinton,1,eight million kids every year have health insurance because when i was first lady i worked with democrats and republicans to create the childrens health insurance program
clinton,1,hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because i worked to change our adoption and foster care system
clinton,1,after 9 11 i went to work with republican mayor governor and president to rebuild new york and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run towards danger and gotten sickened by it
clinton,1,hundreds of thousands of national guard and reserve members have healthcare because of work that i did and children have safer medicines because i was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done
clinton,1,when i was secretary of state i went around the world advocating for our country but also advocating for womens rights to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with russia to lower nuclear weapons
clinton,1,400 pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when i was a senator for eight years
clinton,1,i worked very hard and was proud to be reelected in new york by an even bigger margin than i had been elected the first time
clinton,1,and as president i will take that work that bipartisan work that finding common ground
clinton,1,because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in washington
clinton,1,and i have proven that i can and for thirty years i’ve produced results for the people
clinton,1, i did not say that
trump,0, you know under our constitution presidents have something called veto power

trump,0,400 pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when i was a senator for eight years
trump,0,i worked very hard and was proud to be reelected in new york by an even bigger margin than i had been elected the first time

trump,0,and i have proven that i can and for thirty years i’ve produced results for the people
trump,0, i did not say that
clinton,1, but its because i see this    we need to have strong growth fair growth sustained growth
clinton,1,we also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business
clinton,1,    them to be assaulted
clinton,1, but its because i see this    we need to have strong growth fair growth sustained growth
clinton,1,we also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business
clinton,1,    them to be assaulted
clinton,1,so we have a very robust set of plans
clinton,1,and people have looked at both of our plans have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 35 million jobs and explode the debt which would have a recession
clinton,1, but she said a lot of things that were false
clinton,1,i think we should   
clinton,1, i did not say that

trump,0, i did not say that
trump,0, you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history
trump,0,you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history
trump,0,you are going to drive business out
trump,0,your regulations are a disaster and youre going to increase regulations all over the place
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, in fact he went on to say   
clinton,1, you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history
clinton,1,you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history
clinton,1,you are going to drive business out
clinton,1,your regulations are a disaster and youre going to increase regulations all over the place
clinton,1,interruption
clinton,1, in fact he went on to say   
trump,0,and by the way my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan
trump,0,im very proud of it
trump,0,it will create tremendous numbers of new jobs
trump,0,but regulations you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence
trump,0, the situation in syria is catastrophic and everyday that goes by we see the results of the regime by assad in partnership with the iranians on the ground and the russians in the air bombarding places in particular aleppo where there are hundreds of thousands of people probably about 250000 people still left
trump,0,and there is a determined effort by the russian air force to destroy aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the syrian rebels who are really holding out against the assad regime
trump,0,russia hasnt paid any attention to isis
trump,0,they are interested in keeping assad in power
trump,0,so i when i was secretary of state advocated and i advocate today a no fly and safe zones
trump,0,we need some leverage with the russians because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution unless there is leverage over them
trump,0,and we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground
trump,0,but i want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and aggressiveness of russia
trump,0,russia has decided it is all in in syria and they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the united states too and its not me
trump,0,i stood up to russia i’ve taken on putin and others and i would do that as president
trump,0,i think wherever we can cooperate with russia thats fine and i did as secretary of state thats how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons it’s how we got the sanctions on iran that put a lid on the nuclear weapons program without firing a single shot
trump,0,so i would go with more leverage than we have now
trump,0,but i support the efforts to investigate for crimes war crimes committed by the syrians and the russians and try to hold them accountable
clinton,1,and by the way my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan

clinton,1, he went on to say “look at her i don’t think so” about another woman he said “that wouldnt be my first choice” he attacked the woman reporter writing the story called her disgusting as he has called a number of women during this campaign
clinton,1,donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger
clinton,1,he goes after their dignity their self worth and i dont think there is a woman anywhere that doesnt know what that feels like
clinton,1,so we now know what donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women

clinton,1,i think its really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president how we want to bring our country together where we dont want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other where instead we celebrate our diversity we lift people up and we make our country even greater
clinton,1,america is great because america is good
clinton,1,and it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren

clinton,1,interruption
clinton,1, you were still in contact with the white house
clinton,1,and perhaps sadly obama probably still listened to you
clinton,1,i dont think he would listen to you very much anymore
clinton,1,obama draws the line in the sand
clinton,1,it was laughed at all over the world what happened
clinton,1,now with that being said she talks tough against russia but our nuclear program has fallen way behind and they have gone wild with their nuclear program
clinton,1,not good
clinton,1,our government shouldn’t have allowed that to happen
clinton,1,russia is new in terms of nuclear and we are old and tired and exhausted in terms of nuclear

trump,0,but if you look at russia just take a look at russia and look at what they did this week and i agree she wasnt there but possibly she’s consulted
trump,0,we sign a peace treaty and everyone’s all excited but what russia did with assad and by the way with iran who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps i have seen in the history of making with the $150 billion and with the $17 billion in cash which is enough cash to fill up this room but look at that deal

clinton,1,i dont think american troops should be holding territory which is what they would have to do as an occupying force
clinton,1,i dont think that is a smart strategy
clinton,1,i do think the use of special forces which we’re using the use of enablers and trainers in iraq which has had positive effects are very much in our interests
clinton,1,so i do support what is happening
clinton,1, and its a criminal enterprise

clinton,1,and you take a look at the people of haiti
clinton,1,i was in little haiti the other day in florida and i want to tell you they hate the clintons because whats happened in haiti with the clinton foundation is a disgrace

trump,0,and you know donald said he knows more about isis than the generals
trump,0,no he doesnt
trump,0,there are a lot of very important planning going on and some of it is to signal to the sunnis in the area as well as kurdish peshmerga fighters that we all need to be in this
trump,0,and that takes a lot of planning and preparation
trump,0,i would go after baghdadi 
trump,0,i would specifically target baghdadi
trump,0,because i think our targeting of al qaeda leaders and i was involved in a lot of those operations highly classified ones made a difference
trump,0,i think that could help
trump,0,i would consider arming the kurds
trump,0,the kurds have been our best partners in syria as well as iraq
trump,0,and i know there’s a lot of concern about that in some circles but they should have the equipment they need so that kurdish and arab fighters on the ground are the principal way we take raqqa after pushing isis out of iraq
clinton,1, see youre telling the enemy everything you want to do

clinton,1, you know that’s funny
clinton,1,she went over a minute over and you dont stop her
clinton,1,when i go one second over   
clinton,1, well very quickly we at the clinton foundation spend 90% 90% of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs for people around the world and in our own country
clinton,1,i’m very proud of that
clinton,1,we have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations
clinton,1,and i would be happy to compare what we do with the trump foundation which took money from other people and bought a six foot portrait of donald
clinton,1,i mean who does that
clinton,1,i mean it just was astonishing
clinton,1,but when it comes to haiti haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere
clinton,1,the earthquake and the hurricanes it has devastated haiti
clinton,1,bill and i have been involved in trying to help haiti for many years
clinton,1,the clinton foundation raised $30 million to help haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had
clinton,1,weve done things to help small businesses agriculture and so much else
clinton,1,and were going to keep working to help haiti because it is an important part of the american experience

trump,0, i dont want you to help them anymore
trump,0,id like to mention one thing
trump,0,trump foundation small foundation
trump,0,people contribute
trump,0,i contribute
trump,0,the money goes 100% 100% goes to different charities including a lot of military
trump,0,i don’t get anything
trump,0,i dont buy boats
trump,0,i dont buy planes
trump,0, its very interesting
trump,0, well im really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs
trump,0,theyre going to expand their companies
trump,0,theyre going to do a tremendous job
trump,0, no we put up the american flag and thats it
trump,0,they put up the american flag
trump,0,we fought for the right in palm beach to put up the american flag
trump,0, well im really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs
trump,0,theyre going to expand their companies
trump,0,theyre going to do a tremendous job
trump,0, no we put up the american flag and thats it
trump,0,they put up the american flag
trump,0,we fought for the right in palm beach to put up the american flag
trump,0,im getting rid of the carried interest provision
trump,0,and if you really look its not a tax    its really not a great thing for the wealthy
trump,0,its a great thing for the middle class
trump,0,its a great thing for companies to expand
trump,0,and when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and when theyre going to bring $25 trillion back from overseas where they cant bring the money back because politicians like secretary clinton wont allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape so what    is so bad
trump,0, there was there was and by the way the money went to fisher house where they build houses the money that youre talking about went to fisher house where they build houses for veterans and disabled veterans
trump,0,and when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and when theyre going to bring $25 trillion back from overseas where they cant bring the money back because politicians like secretary clinton wont allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape so what    is so bad
trump,0, there was there was and by the way the money went to fisher house where they build houses the money that youre talking about went to fisher house where they build houses for veterans and disabled veterans
trump,0,so what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country and theyre believe it or not leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country
trump,0,and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they cant work out a deal to    and everybody agrees it should be brought back
trump,0, absolutely
trump,0,i mean she calls our people deplorable
trump,0,a large group
trump,0,and irredeemable
trump,0,i will be a president for all of our people
trump,0,and i’lll be a people that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back
trump,0,because nafta signed by her husband is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world
trump,0,not of this country
trump,0,it stripped us of manufacturing jobs
trump,0,we lost our jobs we lost our money we lost our plants
trump,0,it is a disaster
trump,0, of course theres no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasnt released his tax returns
trump,0,hes the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40 plus years who has not released his tax returns
trump,0,so everything he says about charity or anything else we cant prove it
trump,0,you can look at our tax returns
trump,0,we’ve got them all out there
trump,0,what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax
trump,0,and we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago chris
trump,0,half of all undocumented immigrants actually pay federal income tax
trump,0,so we have undocumented immigrants in america who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire
trump,0,i find that just astonishing
trump,0,so what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country and theyre believe it or not leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country

trump,0,instead of that theyre leaving our country to get their money because they cant bring their money back into our country because of bureaucratic red tape because they cant get together
trump,0,because we have    we have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something
trump,0,and now she wants to sign tpp even though she said now she’s for it
trump,0,she called it the gold standard
trump,0,and by the way at the last debate she lied
trump,0,because it turns out that she did say the gold standard and said she didnt say it
trump,0,they actually said that she lied
trump,0,okay
trump,0,and she lied
trump,0,because it turned out she did say the gold standard and she said she didn’t say it
trump,0,but she lied about a lot of things
trump,0,i would be a president for all of the people
trump,0,african americans the inner cities
trump,0,devastating whats happening to our inner cities
trump,0,she’s been talking about for years
trump,0,as usual she talks about it nothing happens
trump,0,she doesnt get it done
trump,0,same with the latino americans
trump,0,the hispanic americans
trump,0,the same exact thing
trump,0,they talk
trump,0,theydont get it done
trump,0,you go into the inner cities its 45% poverty
trump,0,african americans now 45% poverty in the inner cities
trump,0,the education is a disaster
trump,0,jobs are essentially nonexistent
trump,0,i mean i’ve been saying in big speeches where i have 20 and 30000 people
trump,0,what do you have to lose
trump,0,it cant get worse
trump,0,she has been talking about the inner cities for 25 years
trump,0,nothing is going to ever happen

trump,0,interruption
clinton,1,  as i said trumped up trickle down
clinton,1,trickle down did not work
clinton,1,it got us into the mess we were in in 2008 and 2009
clinton,1,slashing taxes on the wealthy hasnt worked
clinton,1, we have the slowest growth and our country is a disaster
trump,0,  as i said trumped up trickle down

trump,0,slashing taxes on the wealthy hasnt worked
trump,0, we have the slowest growth and our country is a disaster
clinton,1,and a lot of really smart wealthy people know that
clinton,1,and they are saying hey we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class
clinton,1,   it just shows youre not up to doing the job
clinton,1,and lets be clear about what hes saying and what that means
clinton,1,hes denigrating he is talking down our democracy
clinton,1,and i for one am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position
clinton,1,and a lot of really smart wealthy people know that

clinton,1,hes denigrating he is talking down our democracy
clinton,1,and i for one am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position
clinton,1, i dont think top down works in america
clinton,1,i think building the middle class investing in the middle class making college debt free so more young people can get their education helping people refinance their    their debt from college at a lower rate
clinton,1,those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy
clinton,1,broad based inclusive growth is what we need in america not more advantages for people at the very top
clinton,1, i think what the fbi did and what the department of justice did including meeting with her husband the attorney general in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in arizona i think its disgraceful
clinton,1,i think its a disgrace
trump,0, i dont think top down works in america
trump,0,i think building the middle class investing in the middle class making college debt free so more young people can get their education helping people refinance their    their debt from college at a lower rate

trump,0, typical politician
trump,0,all talk no action
trump,0,sounds good doesnt work
trump,0,never going to happen
trump,0,our country is suffering because people like secretary clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of whats going on
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, thank you
trump,0,you are right
trump,0,this is one of the most important issues in this election
trump,0,i want to appoint supreme court justices who understand the way the world really works who have real life experience
trump,0,who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench but maybe they tried more cases
trump,0,actually understand what people are up against
trump,0,because i think the current court has gone in the wrong direction
trump,0,i would want to see the supreme court reverse citizens united and get dark unaccountable money out of our politics
trump,0,donald doesnt agree with that
trump,0,i would like the supreme court to understand that voting rights are a big problem in many parts of the country
trump,0,that we dont do always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise
trump,0,i want a supreme court that will stick with roe v wade and a woman’s right to choose and i want a supreme court that will stick with marriage equality
trump,0,now donald put forth of the names of people he would consider
trump,0,and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse roe v wade and reverse marriage equality
trump,0,i think that would would be a terrible mistake and take us backwards
trump,0,i want a supreme court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests
trump,0,i want a supreme court that understands because you are wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have more rights or should have any more rights than anything else
trump,0,so i have clear views about what i want to see to change the balance on the supreme court and i regret deeply that the senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that president obama a highly qualified person
trump,0,they have not given him a vote to be able to have the full complement of nine supreme court justices
trump,0,i think that was a dereliction of duty
trump,0,i hope they will see their way to doing it but if i am so fortunate as to be president i will immediately move to make sure that we fill that
trump,0,we have nine justices and that they get to work on behalf of our people
trump,0, i think weve never had a situation so bad

trump,0, i think weve never had a situation so bad
trump,0,now look we have the worst revival of an economy since the great depression
trump,0,and believe me were in a bubble right now
trump,0,and the only thing that looks good is the stock market but if you raise interest rates even a little bit thats going to come crashing down
trump,0,we are in a big fat ugly bubble
trump,0,and we better be awfully careful
trump,0,and we have a fed thats doing political things
trump,0,this janet yellen of the fed
trump,0,the fed is doing political    by keeping the interest rates at this level
trump,0,and believe me the day obama goes off and he leaves and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf when they raise interest rates youre going to see some very bad things happen because the fed is not doing their job
trump,0,the fed is being more political than secretary clinton
trump,0, justice scalia great judge died recently and we have a vacancy
trump,0,i am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of justice scalia
trump,0,i am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them
trump,0,so that people would say highly respected
trump,0,highly thought of and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody
trump,0,but people that will respect the constitution of the united states
trump,0,and i think that this is so important
trump,0,also the second amendment which is totally under siege by people like hillary clinton
trump,0,they’ll respect the second amendment and what it stands for and what it represents
trump,0,we are in a big fat ugly bubble
trump,0,and we better be awfully careful
trump,0,and we have a fed thats doing political things
trump,0,this janet yellen of the fed

trump,0,they’ll respect the second amendment and what it stands for and what it represents
trump,0,now hillary mentioned contributions
trump,0,just so you could i will have in my race more than $100 million put in of my money
trump,0,meaning i’m not taking all of this big money from all of these corporations like she is doing
trump,0,what i ask is this so i am putting in by the time its finished i’ll have more than 100 million dollars invested
trump,0,pretty much self funding mine
trump,0,we’re raising money for the republican party and we’re doing tremendously on the small donations
trump,0,$61 average or so
trump,0, well i am encouraged there is an effort led by the iraqi army supported by kurdish forces and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other americans on the ground but i will not support putting american soldiers into iraq as an occupying force
trump,0,i dont think that is in our interest and i dont think that would be smart to do
trump,0,in fact chris i think that would be a big red flag waving for isis to reconstitute itself
trump,0,the goal here is to take back mosul
trump,0,its going to be a hard fight
trump,0,ive got no illusions about that
trump,0,and then continue to press into syria to begin to take back and move on raqqa which is the isis headquarters
trump,0,i am hopeful that the hard work that american military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a really successful military operation
trump,0,but we know weve got lots of work to do
trump,0,syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the iranians and the russians continue so i have said look we need to keep our eye on isis
trump,0,thats why i want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home why we have to go after them from the air on the ground online why we have to make sure here at home we dont let terrorists buy weapons
trump,0,if youre too dangerous to fly youre too dangerous to buy a gun
trump,0,and im going to continue to push for a no fly zone and safe havens within syria not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to frankly gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track
clinton,1,now hillary mentioned contributions

trump,0,i respect the second amendment but i believe there should be background checks and we should close the gun show loophole and close the online loophole
trump,0,so we’re now fighting for mosul
trump,0,that we had
trump,0,all she had to do was stay there now we’re going in to get it
trump,0,but you know who the big winner in mosul is going to be after we eventually get it    and the only reason they did it is because shes running for office of president and they want to look tough
trump,0,they want to look good
trump,0,he violated the red line in the sand and he made so many mistakes
trump,0,he made all mistakes
trump,0,thats why we have the great migration but she wanted to look good for the election
trump,0,so they’re going in
clinton,1,but thats the kind of thinking that our country needs
clinton,1,when we have a country thats doing so badly thats being ripped off by every single country in the world its the kind of thinking that our country needs because everybody    lester we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with of almost $800 billion a year
clinton,1,you know what that is
clinton,1,that means whos negotiating these trade deals

trump,0,we have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals
trump,0,but who is going to get mosul really
trump,0,well take mosul eventually
trump,0,by the way if you look at whats happening much tougher than they thought
trump,0,much much tougher
trump,0,much more dangerous going to be more deaths than they thought
trump,0,but the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because theyre smart
trump,0,they say what do we need this for
trump,0,so mosul is going to be a wonderful thing and iran should write us a letter of thank you
trump,0,just like the really stupid the stupidest deal of all time a deal thats going to give iran absolutely nuclear weapons
trump,0,iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because iran as i said many years ago iran is taking over iraq
trump,0,something theyve wanted to do forever but weve made it so easy for them
trump,0,so were now going to take mosul and you know who is going to be the beneficiary
trump,0,iran
trump,0,boy are they making they are outsmarting… look youre not there
trump,0,you might be involved in that decision but you were there when you took everybody out of mosul and out of iraq
trump,0,you shouldnt have been in iraq but you did vote for it
trump,0,you shouldnt have been in iraq but once you were in iraq you should have never left the way    the point is the big winner is going to be iran
trump,0,we have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals
trump,0,but who is going to get mosul really
trump,0,well take mosul eventually
trump,0,by the way if you look at whats happening much tougher than they thought

trump,0,you shouldnt have been in iraq but once you were in iraq you should have never left the way    the point is the big winner is going to be iran
clinton,1, well you know once again donald is implying that he didnt support the invasion of iraq
clinton,1,i said it was a mistake
clinton,1,i said that years ago
clinton,1,he has consistently denied what is   
trump,0, excuse me
trump,0, wrong
trump,0, excuse me
trump,0, wrong
clinton,1,    is a very clear fact that before the invasion
trump,0, well i told you i will release them as soon as the audit
trump,0,look ive been under audit almost for 15 years
trump,0,i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited
trump,0,i said do you get audited
trump,0,i get audited almost every year
trump,0, such a great question because energy is under siege by the obama administration
trump,0,under absolute siege
trump,0,the epa environmental protection agency is killing these energy companies
trump,0,and foreign companies are now coming in
trump,0,buying so many of our different plants and then rejiggering the plant so they take care of their oil
trump,0,we are killing absolutely killing our energy business in this country
trump,0,now i am all for alternative forms of energy including wind and solar etc
trump,0,but we need much more than wind and solar
trump,0,and you look at the miners hillary clinton wants to put the miners out of business
trump,0,there is a thing called clean coal
trump,0,coal will last for 1000 years in this country
trump,0,now we have natural gas and so other things because of technology we have unbelievable we have found over the last seven years we found tremendous wealth right under our feet
trump,0,so good especially when you have $20 trillion in debt
trump,0,i will bring our energy companies back and they will be able to compete and they’ll make money and pay off our national debt and budget deficits which are tremendous
trump,0,but we are putting our energy companies out of business
trump,0,we have to bring back our workers
trump,0,you take a look at whats happening to steel and the cost of steel and china dumping vast amounts steel all over the united states which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies
trump,0,we have to guard our energy companies we have to make it possible
trump,0,the epa is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business
trump,0,and all you have to do is go to a great place like west virginia or places like ohio which is phenomenal or places like pennsylvania and you see what they are doing to the people miners and others in the energy business
trump,0,its a disgrace
trump,0,it’s an absolute disgrace
trump,0, wrong
trump,0, well i told you i will release them as soon as the audit

trump,0,its a disgrace
trump,0,it’s an absolute disgrace
trump,0, wrong
trump,0,and in a way i should be complaining
trump,0,im not even complaining
trump,0,i dont mind it
trump,0,its almost become a way of life
trump,0,i get audited by the irs
trump,0,but other people dont
trump,0,    he supported it
trump,0,i just want everybody to go google it
trump,0,“google donald trump iraq” and youll see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of iraq
clinton,1,and in a way i should be complaining
clinton,1,im not even complaining
clinton,1,i dont mind it
clinton,1,its almost become a way of life
clinton,1,i get audited by the irs
clinton,1,but other people dont
clinton,1,    he supported it
clinton,1,i just want everybody to go google it
clinton,1,“google donald trump iraq” and youll see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of iraq
trump,0,i will say this
trump,0,we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of
trump,0,i will release my tax returns    against my lawyers wishes    when she releases her 33000 e mails that have been deleted
trump,0,as soon as she releases them i will release
trump,0, well that was very interesting
trump,0,first of all china is illegally dumping steel in the united states and donald trump is buying it to build his buildings putting steelworkers and american steel plants out of business
trump,0,thats something that i fought against as a senator and something i would have a trade prosecutor to make sure we dont get taken advantage of by china on steel or anything else
trump,0,you know because it sounds like you are in the business or you’re aware of people in the business
trump,0,you know that we are now for the first time energy independent
trump,0,we are not dependent on the middle east but the middle east controls a lot of prices
trump,0,so the price of oil has been way down and that has a damaging effect on a lot the oil companies right
trump,0,we are however producing a lot of natural gas that serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels and i think thats an important transition
trump,0,we’ve got to remain energy independent
trump,0,it gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle east
trump,0,we have enough worried over there without having to worry about that
trump,0,so i have a comprehensive energy policy but it really does include fighting climate change because i think that is a serious problem
trump,0,and i support moving towards more clean renewable energy as quickly as we can
trump,0,because i think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses
trump,0,but i want to be sure that we dont leave people behind
trump,0,that’s why im the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country
trump,0,because those coal miners and their fathers and grandfathers they dug that coal out a lot of them lost their lives
trump,0,they were injured
trump,0,but they turn the lights on and powered our factories
trump,0,i dont want to walk away from them
trump,0,so we’ve got to do something for them
trump,0,but the price of coal is down worldwide
trump,0,we have to look at this comprehensively and thats what i have proposed
trump,0,i hope you will go to hillaryclintoncom and read my entire policy
trump,0, wrong
clinton,1,i will say this
clinton,1,we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of
clinton,1,i will release my tax returns    against my lawyers wishes    when she releases her 33000 e mails that have been deleted

trump,0,we have to look at this comprehensively and thats what i have proposed
trump,0,i hope you will go to hillaryclintoncom and read my entire policy
trump,0, wrong
clinton,1, and you can hear the audio of him saying that
clinton,1,why does that matter
clinton,1,well it matters because he has not told the truth about that position
clinton,1,i guess he believes it makes him look better to contrast with me because i did vote for it
clinton,1,but whats really important here is to understand all the interplay
clinton,1,mosul is a sunni city
clinton,1,mosul is on the border of syria and yes we do need to go after baghdadi just like we went after bin laden while you were doing celebrity apprentice and we brought him to justice
clinton,1,we need to go after the leadership but we need to get rid of them get rid of their fighters
clinton,1,there are several thousand fighters in mosul
clinton,1,they’ve been digging underground
clinton,1,they’ve been prepared to defend
clinton,1,its going to be tough fighting but i think we can take back mosul and then we can move on into syria and take back raqqa
trump,0,i will release my tax returns
trump,0,and thats against    my lawyers they say dont do it
trump,0,i will tell you this
trump,0,no    in fact watching shows theyre reading the papers
trump,0,almost every lawyer says you dont release your returns until the audits complete
trump,0,when the audits complete ill do it
trump,0,but i would go against them if she releases her e mails
trump,0,this is what we have to do
trump,0,im just am amazed that he seems to think the iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on mosul to help me in this election but that’s how donald thinks you know he always is looking for some conspiracy  
clinton,1,i will release my tax returns
clinton,1,and thats against    my lawyers they say dont do it
clinton,1,i will tell you this
clinton,1,no    in fact watching shows theyre reading the papers
clinton,1,almost every lawyer says you dont release your returns until the audits complete

clinton,1,im just am amazed that he seems to think the iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on mosul to help me in this election but that’s how donald thinks you know he always is looking for some conspiracy  
trump,0, we dont gain anything
trump,0,iran is taking over   
clinton,1, well i certainly will because i think thats a very fair and important question
clinton,1,well i respect his children
clinton,1,his children are incredibly able and devoted and i think that says a lot about donald
clinton,1,i dont agree with nearly anything else he says or does but i do respect that and think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me
clinton,1,so i believe that this election has become in part so conflict oriented so intense because there is a lot at stake
clinton,1,this is not an ordinary time and this is not an ordinary election
clinton,1,we are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years but because some of the important decisions we have to make at home and around the world from the supreme court to energy and so much else and so there is a lot at stake its one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had — and thats why i tried to put forth specific policies and plans — trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is on i want to do as president
clinton,1,and thats why i hope people will check on that for themselves
clinton,1,so that they can see that yes i spent 30 years actually a little more working to help kids and families and i want to take all that experience to the white house and do that every single day
trump,0, iran is taking over iraq
clinton,1, well i think youve seen another example of bait and  switch here
clinton,1,for 40 years everyone running for president has released their tax returns
clinton,1,you can go and see nearly i think 39 40 years of our tax returns but everyone has done it
clinton,1,we know the irs has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when youre under audit
clinton,1, well i consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment
clinton,1,i dont know if it was meant to be a compliment but it is a great
clinton,1,im proud of my children
clinton,1,they have done a wonderful job and they have been wonderful wonderful kids
clinton,1,so i consider that a compliment
clinton,1,i will say this about hillary
clinton,1,she doesnt quit and she doesnt give up
clinton,1,i respect that
clinton,1,i tell it like it is
clinton,1,she is a fighter
clinton,1,i disagree with much of what she is fighting for i do disagree with her judgment in many cases but she does fights hard and doesnt quit and she doesn’t give up and i consider that a very good trait
clinton,1,   his conspiracy theories 
trump,0, well i think youve seen another example of bait and  switch here
trump,0,for 40 years everyone running for president has released their tax returns
trump,0,you can go and see nearly i think 39 40 years of our tax returns but everyone has done it

trump,0,i respect that
trump,0,i tell it like it is
trump,0,she is a fighter
trump,0,i disagree with much of what she is fighting for i do disagree with her judgment in many cases but she does fights hard and doesnt quit and she doesn’t give up and i consider that a very good trait

clinton,1,she is a fighter
clinton,1,i disagree with much of what she is fighting for i do disagree with her judgment in many cases but she does fights hard and doesnt quit and she doesn’t give up and i consider that a very good trait
clinton,1,   his conspiracy theories 
clinton,1,so youve got to ask yourself why wont he release his tax returns
clinton,1,and i think there may be a couple of reasons
clinton,1,first maybe hes not as rich as he says he is
clinton,1,second maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be
clinton,1, third we dont know all of his business dealings but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to wall street and foreign banks
clinton,1,or maybe he doesnt want the american people all of you watching tonight to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax
clinton,1, we would have gained   
trump,0, third we dont know all of his business dealings but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to wall street and foreign banks
trump,0,or maybe he doesnt want the american people all of you watching tonight to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax
trump,0, we would have gained   
trump,0, that makes me smart
trump,0,interruption
trump,0, for quite sometime   
clinton,1, that makes me smart
clinton,1,interruption
clinton,1, for quite sometime   
clinton,1, so if hes paid zero that means zero for troops zero for vets zero for schools or health
clinton,1,and i think probably hes not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are because it must be something really important even terrible that hes trying to hide
clinton,1,and the financial disclosure statements they dont give you the tax rate
clinton,1,they dont give you all the details that tax returns would
clinton,1,and it just seems to me that this is something that the american people deserve to see
clinton,1,and i have no reason to believe that hes ever going to release his tax returns because theres something hes hiding
clinton,1, he’s unfit
clinton,1,he proves it every time
clinton,1,and the financial disclosure statements they dont give you the tax rate
clinton,1,they dont give you all the details that tax returns would
clinton,1,and it just seems to me that this is something that the american people deserve to see
clinton,1,and i have no reason to believe that hes ever going to release his tax returns because theres something hes hiding
clinton,1, he’s unfit
clinton,1,he proves it every time
clinton,1,and well guess

clinton,1, no youre the one thats unfit
clinton,1,you know wikileaks just actually came out

clinton,1,and if you think going into mosul after we let the world know were going in and all of the people we really wanted the leaders are all gone if you think that was good then you do
clinton,1,now john podesta said you have terrible instincts
clinton,1,bernie sanders said you have bad judgment

trump,0,and well guess
trump,0,well keep guessing at what it might be that hes hiding

trump,0,now john podesta said you have terrible instincts
trump,0,bernie sanders said you have bad judgment
trump,0,i agree with both
clinton,1, well you should ask bernie sanders who he is supporting for president
clinton,1, i do
clinton,1,you know i made a mistake using a private e  mail

clinton,1, which is a big mistake
trump,0, i do
trump,0,you know i made a mistake using a private e  mail
trump,0,trump thats for sure
trump,0, which is a big mistake
clinton,1, and if i had to do it over again i would obviously do it differently
clinton,1,but im not going to make any excuses
clinton,1,it was a mistake and i take responsibility for that
clinton,1, and he said you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of america
clinton,1,i think hes right
clinton,1, and if i had to do it over again i would obviously do it differently
clinton,1,but im not going to make any excuses
clinton,1,it was a mistake and i take responsibility for that
clinton,1, and he said you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of america
clinton,1,i think hes right
trump,0, that was more than a mistake
trump,0,that was done purposely
trump,0,ok
trump,0,that was not a mistake
trump,0,that was done purposely
trump,0,when you have your staff taking the fifth amendment taking the fifth so theyre not prosecuted when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth i think its disgraceful
trump,0,and believe me this country thinks its    really thinks its disgraceful also
trump,0, its a catastrophe
trump,0, that was more than a mistake
trump,0,that was done purposely
trump,0,ok
trump,0,that was not a mistake
trump,0,that was done purposely
trump,0,when you have your staff taking the fifth amendment taking the fifth so theyre not prosecuted when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth i think its disgraceful
trump,0,and believe me this country thinks its    really thinks its disgraceful also
trump,0, its a catastrophe
trump,0,as far as my tax returns you dont learn that much from tax returns
trump,0,that i can tell you
trump,0,you learn a lot from financial disclosure
trump,0,and you should go down and take a look at that
trump,0,the other thing im extremely underleveraged
trump,0,the report that said $650    which by the way a lot of friends of mine that know my business say boy thats really not a lot of money
trump,0,its not a lot of money relative to what i had
trump,0, it’s a mess
trump,0,have you seen it
trump,0,have you seen it
trump,0,have you seen what’s happened to aleppo
trump,0,the other thing im extremely underleveraged
trump,0,the report that said $650    which by the way a lot of friends of mine that know my business say boy thats really not a lot of money
trump,0,its not a lot of money relative to what i had
trump,0, it’s a mess
trump,0,have you seen it
trump,0,have you seen it
trump,0,have you seen what’s happened to aleppo
trump,0,the buildings that were in question they said in the same report which was    actually it wasnt even a bad story to be honest with you but the buildings are worth $39 billion
trump,0,and the $650 isnt even on that
trump,0,but its not $650
trump,0,its much less than that
trump,0,but i could give you a list of banks i would    if that would help you i would give you a list of banks
trump,0,these are very fine institutions very fine banks
trump,0,i could do that very quickly
trump,0, okay so it hasn’t fallentake a look at it
trump,0,but i could give you a list of banks i would    if that would help you i would give you a list of banks
trump,0,these are very fine institutions very fine banks
trump,0,i could do that very quickly
trump,0, okay so it hasn’t fallentake a look at it
trump,0,i am very underleveraged
trump,0,i have a great company
trump,0,i have a tremendous income
trump,0,and the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way
trump,0,its because its about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money
trump,0,when we have $20 trillion in debt and our countrys a mess you know its one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape our airports
trump,0,our airports are like from a third world country
trump,0, that’s right
trump,0,and they are being slaughtered because of bad decisions
trump,0,when we have $20 trillion in debt and our countrys a mess you know its one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape our airports
trump,0,our airports are like from a third world country
trump,0, that’s right
trump,0,and they are being slaughtered because of bad decisions
trump,0,you land at laguardia you land at kennedy you land at lax you land at newark and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible    you come in from china you see these incredible airports and you land    weve become a third world country
trump,0,so the worst of all things has happened
trump,0,we owe $20 trillion and were a mess
trump,0,we havent even started
trump,0,and weve spent $6 trillion in the middle east according to a report that i just saw
trump,0,whether its 6 or 5 but it looks like its 6 $6 trillion in the middle east we could have rebuilt our country twice
trump,0, well aleppo is a disaster
trump,0,it’s a humanitarian nightmare but it has fallen from any standpoint
trump,0,what do you need a signed document
trump,0,take a look at aleppo
trump,0,it is so sad when you see whats happened
trump,0,and a lot of this is because of hillary clinton
trump,0,because whats happened is by fighting assad who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought    now shes going to say oh he loves assad
trump,0,hes much tougher and much smarter than her and obama
trump,0,and everyone thought he was gone two years ago three years ago
trump,0,he aligned with russia
trump,0,he now also aligned with iran who we made very powerful
trump,0,we gave them $150 billion back
trump,0,we gave them $17 billion in cash
trump,0,i mean cash bundles of cash as big as this stage
trump,0,we gave them $17 billion
trump,0,so the worst of all things has happened
trump,0,we owe $20 trillion and were a mess
trump,0,we havent even started
trump,0,and weve spent $6 trillion in the middle east according to a report that i just saw

trump,0,we gave them $17 billion in cash
trump,0,i mean cash bundles of cash as big as this stage
trump,0,we gave them $17 billion
trump,0,and its really a shame
trump,0,and its politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem
trump,0,our country has tremendous problems
trump,0,were a debtor nation
trump,0,were a serious debtor nation
trump,0,and we have a country that needs new roads new tunnels new bridges new airports new schools new hospitals
trump,0,and we dont have the money because its been squandered on so many of your ideas
trump,0,now they have lined    he has aligned with russia and with iran
trump,0,they dont want isis but they have other things because were backing were backing rebels
trump,0,we dont know who the rebels are
trump,0,were giving them lots of money lots of everything
trump,0,we dont know who the rebels are and when and if    and its not going to happen because you have russia and you have iran now
trump,0,but if they ever did overthrow assad you might end up with as bad as assad is
trump,0,and he’s a bad guy
trump,0,but you may very well end up with worse than assad
trump,0,if she did nothing we would be in much better shape
trump,0,and this is whats caused the great migration where shes taking in tens of thousands of syrian refugees who probably in many cases    not probably who are definitely in many cases isis aligned
trump,0,and we now have them in our country
trump,0,wait til you see    this is going to be the great trojan horse
trump,0,wait til you see what happens in the coming years
trump,0,lots of luck hillary
trump,0,thanks a lot for doing a great job

trump,0,lots of luck hillary
trump,0,thanks a lot for doing a great job
clinton,1, and maybe because you havent paid any federal income tax for a lot of years
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1, well chris first of all i think a no fly zone could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict
clinton,1,i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general
clinton,1,this would not be done just on the first daythis would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the russians and the syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground
clinton,1,weve had millions of people leave syria and those millions of people inside syria who’ve been dislocated
clinton,1,so i think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the russians and syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in syria
clinton,1,it would help us in the fight against isis
clinton,1, and maybe because you havent paid any federal income tax for a lot of years
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1, well chris first of all i think a no fly zone could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict

clinton,1,it would help us in the fight against isis
clinton,1,and the other thing i think is important
clinton,1,but i want to respond to what donald said about refugees made these claims repeatedly
clinton,1,i am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted who we do not have confidence in but i am not going to slam the door on women and children
clinton,1,that picture of that little 4 year old boy in aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting and so we are going to do very careful thorough vetting
clinton,1,that does not solve our internal challenges with isis and our need to stop radicalization to work with american muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks
clinton,1,in fact the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in orlando the pulse night club was born in queens the same place donald was born
clinton,1,so lets be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it
clinton,1,yes some of that threat emanates from over in syria and iraq and weve got to keep fighting
clinton,1,and i will defeat isis
clinton,1,and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home
clinton,1,and the other thing i think is important
clinton,1,but i want to respond to what donald said about refugees made these claims repeatedly
clinton,1,i am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted who we do not have confidence in but i am not going to slam the door on women and children

clinton,1,and i will defeat isis
clinton,1,and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home
trump,0, it would be squandered too believe me
clinton,1,  is if your    if your main claim to be president of the united states is your business then i think we should talk about that
clinton,1,you know your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys
clinton,1, but i just have too it’s so ridiculous what she… she will defeat isis
clinton,1,we should never have let isis happen in the first place
clinton,1,and right now they are in 32 countries   
trump,0,  is if your    if your main claim to be president of the united states is your business then i think we should talk about that
trump,0,you know your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys
trump,0, but i just have too it’s so ridiculous what she… she will defeat isis
trump,0,we should never have let isis happen in the first place
trump,0,and right now they are in 32 countries   
clinton,1,and indeed i have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses donald
clinton,1,ive met dishwashers painters architects glass installers marble installers drapery installers like my dad was who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do
clinton,1,we have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses
clinton,1,its a beautiful facility
clinton,1,it immediately was put to use
clinton,1,and you wouldnt pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you to do
clinton,1, wait one second
clinton,1,they had a cease fire three weeks ago
clinton,1,a ceasefire united states russia syria
clinton,1,and during the cease fire russia took over vast swathes of land and then they said we dont want the cease fire anymore
clinton,1,we are so outplayed on missiles on ceasefires
clinton,1,they are outplayed
clinton,1,she wasnt there
clinton,1,i assume she had nothing to do with it but our country is so outplayed by putin and assad and by the way and by iran
clinton,1,nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is
trump,0,we have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses
trump,0,its a beautiful facility
trump,0,it immediately was put to use

trump,0,nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is
trump,0, maybe he didnt do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work
clinton,1, well to
clinton,1, well i saw theyre wrong because i’m going to create tremendous jobs
clinton,1,and were bringing gdp from really 1% which is what it is now and if she got in it would be less than zero but we’re bringing it from 1% up to 4% and i actually think we can go higher than 4%
clinton,1,i think you can go to 5% or 6%
clinton,1,and if we do you don’t have to bother asking your question
clinton,1,because we have a tremendous machine
clinton,1,we will have created a tremendous economic machine once again
clinton,1,to do that were taking back jobs
clinton,1,were not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs
clinton,1,we dont make our product anymore
clinton,1,its very sad but i am going to create a… the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry
clinton,1,we used to be there
clinton,1,weve given it up
clinton,1,weve become very very sloppy
clinton,1,weve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world
clinton,1,bigger than companies
clinton,1,you take these big companies
trump,0, well to
trump,0, well i saw theyre wrong because i’m going to create tremendous jobs
trump,0,and were bringing gdp from really 1% which is what it is now and if she got in it would be less than zero but we’re bringing it from 1% up to 4% and i actually think we can go higher than 4%

trump,0,weve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world
trump,0,bigger than companies
trump,0,you take these big companies
trump,0, which our country should do too
trump,0,these trade deals are far bigger than these companies and yet we dont use our great leaders many of whom back me and many of whom backed hillary i must say but we dont use those people
trump,0,those are the peoplethese are the greatest negotiators in the world
trump,0,we have the greatest business people in the world
trump,0,we have to use them to negotiate our trade deals
trump,0,we use political hacks
trump,0,we use people that get the position because they made a campaign contribution and theyre dealing with china and people that are very much smarter than they are so we have to use our great people
trump,0,but that being said we will create an economic machine the likes of which we havent seen in many decades and people chris will again go back to work and theyll make a lot of money and well have companies that will will grow and expand and start from new
trump,0, which our country should do too
trump,0,these trade deals are far bigger than these companies and yet we dont use our great leaders many of whom back me and many of whom backed hillary i must say but we dont use those people
trump,0,those are the peoplethese are the greatest negotiators in the world

trump,0,but that being said we will create an economic machine the likes of which we havent seen in many decades and people chris will again go back to work and theyll make a lot of money and well have companies that will will grow and expand and start from new
clinton,1, do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor taken the goods that they produced and then refused to pay them
clinton,1,i can only say that im certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you
clinton,1,he provided a good middle class life for us but the people he worked for he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides
clinton,1, well first when i hear donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make america great again
clinton,1,i wonder when he thought america was great
clinton,1,and before he rushes and says you know before you and president obama were there i think its important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades
clinton,1,you know back in 1987 he took out an $100000 ad in the new york times during the time when president reagan was president and basically said exactly what he just said right now
clinton,1,that we were the laughing stock of the world
clinton,1,he was criticizing president reagan
clinton,1,this is the way donald thinks about himself puts himself into you know the middle and says you know ‘i alone can fix it’ as he said on the convention stage
clinton,1,i can only say that im certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you
clinton,1,he provided a good middle class life for us but the people he worked for he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides
clinton,1, well first when i hear donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make america great again
clinton,1,i wonder when he thought america was great
clinton,1,and before he rushes and says you know before you and president obama were there i think its important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades

clinton,1,he was criticizing president reagan
clinton,1,this is the way donald thinks about himself puts himself into you know the middle and says you know ‘i alone can fix it’ as he said on the convention stage
clinton,1,and when we talk about your business youve taken business bankruptcy six times
clinton,1,there are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once
clinton,1,you call yourself the king of debt
clinton,1,you talk about leverage
clinton,1,you even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the united states
clinton,1,but if you look at the debt which is the issue you asked about chris i pay for everything im proposing
clinton,1,i do not add a penny to the national debt
clinton,1,i take that very seriously because i do think its one of the issues weve got to come to grips with
clinton,1,so when i talk about how were going to pay for education how were going to invest in infrastructure how were going to get the cost of prescription drugs down and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time ive made it very clear we are going where the money is
clinton,1,we are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share
clinton,1,and there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth
clinton,1,in fact i think just the opposite
clinton,1,well have what economists call middle outgrowth
clinton,1,weve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class
clinton,1,the families of america
clinton,1,thats where growth will come from
clinton,1,thats why i want to invest in you
clinton,1,i want to invest in your family
clinton,1,and i think thats the smartest way to grow the economy to make the economy fairer
clinton,1,and we just have a big disagreement about this
clinton,1,it may be because of our experiences
clinton,1,you know he started off with his dad as a millionaire
clinton,1,i started off with my dad as a small businessman
clinton,1,and when we talk about your business youve taken business bankruptcy six times
clinton,1,there are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once
clinton,1,you call yourself the king of debt
clinton,1,you talk about leverage

clinton,1,you know he started off with his dad as a millionaire
clinton,1,i started off with my dad as a small businessman
trump,0, wrong
trump,0,wrong
trump,0, weve heard this before hillary
trump,0,weve heard this before
trump,0, wrong
trump,0,wrong
trump,0, weve heard this before hillary
trump,0,weve heard this before
clinton,1, well sometimes theres not a direct transfer of skills from business to government but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government
clinton,1, i think its a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy
clinton,1, well sometimes theres not a direct transfer of skills from business to government but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government
clinton,1, i think its a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy
clinton,1, and we need to be very clear about that
clinton,1, thank you hillary
clinton,1,could i just respond
trump,0, and we need to be very clear about that
trump,0, thank you hillary
trump,0,could i just respond
trump,0, so yeah i think    i do think its time
trump,0,look its all words its all sound bites
trump,0,i built an unbelievable company
trump,0,some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world real estate assets anywhere in the world beyond the united states in europe lots of different places
trump,0,its an unbelievable company
trump,0,but on occasion four times we used certain laws that are there
trump,0,and when secretary clinton talks about people that didnt get paid first of all they did get paid a lot but taken advantage of the laws of the nation
trump,0, because i disagreed with ronald reagan very strongly on trade
trump,0,i disagreed with him
trump,0,we should have been much tougher on trade even then
trump,0,ive been waiting for years
trump,0,nobody does it right
trump,0,and frankly now were going to do it right
trump,0,but on occasion four times we used certain laws that are there
trump,0,and when secretary clinton talks about people that didnt get paid first of all they did get paid a lot but taken advantage of the laws of the nation
trump,0, because i disagreed with ronald reagan very strongly on trade
trump,0,i disagreed with him
trump,0,we should have been much tougher on trade even then
trump,0,ive been waiting for years
trump,0,nobody does it right
trump,0,and frankly now were going to do it right
trump,0,now if you want to change the laws youve been there a long time change the laws
trump,0,but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because im running a company
trump,0,my obligation right now is to do well for myself my family my employees for my companies
trump,0,and thats what i do
trump,0,but what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me
trump,0,ill give you an example
trump,0,were just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house so if i dont get there one way im going to get to pennsylvania avenue another
trump,0, im cutting taxes
trump,0,were going to grow the economy
trump,0,its going to grow in a record rate
trump,0,but what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me
trump,0,ill give you an example
trump,0,were just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house so if i dont get there one way im going to get to pennsylvania avenue another
trump,0, im cutting taxes
trump,0,were going to grow the economy
trump,0,its going to grow in a record rate
trump,0,but were opening the old post office
trump,0,under budget ahead of schedule saved tremendous money
trump,0,im a year ahead of schedule
trump,0,and thats what this country should be doing
trump,0,we build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost
trump,0,we buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be because we dont have people that know what theyre doing
trump,0, it is going to totally help you
trump,0,and one thing we have to do is repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare
trump,0,its destroying our country
trump,0,its destroying our businesses our small business and our big businesses
trump,0,we have to repeal and replace obamacare
trump,0,you take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year 2017
trump,0,it is a disaster if we dont repeal and replace
trump,0,it is probably going to die of its own weight but obamacare has to go
trump,0,the premiums are going up 60% 70% 80%
trump,0,next year theyre going to go up over 100%
trump,0,and i’m really glad that the premiums have started at least the people see whats happening because she wants to keep obamacare and she wants to make it even worse and it cant get any worse
trump,0,bad health care at the most expensive price
trump,0,we have to repeal and replace obamacare
trump,0,we build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost
trump,0,we buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be because we dont have people that know what theyre doing
trump,0, it is going to totally help you
trump,0,and one thing we have to do is repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare

trump,0,next year theyre going to go up over 100%
trump,0,and i’m really glad that the premiums have started at least the people see whats happening because she wants to keep obamacare and she wants to make it even worse and it cant get any worse
trump,0,bad health care at the most expensive price
trump,0,we have to repeal and replace obamacare
trump,0,when we look at the budget the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy
trump,0,the trump international is way under budget and way ahead of schedule
trump,0,and we should be able to do that for our country
clinton,1, well chris i am record as saying we need to put more money into social security trust fund
clinton,1,thats part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy
clinton,1,my social security payroll contribution will go up as will donalds assuming he cant figure out how to get out of it but what we want to do is   
trump,0, such a nasty woman
clinton,1, replenish the trust fund by making sure that we have sufficient resources and that will come from either raising the cap and or finding other ways to get more money into it
clinton,1,i will not cut benefits
clinton,1,i want to enhance benefits for low income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current social security system
clinton,1,but what donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt
clinton,1,that will have dire consequences for social security and medicare
clinton,1,and ill say something about the affordable care act which he wants to repeal
clinton,1,the affordable care act extended the solvency of the medicare trust fund
clinton,1,if he repeals it our medicare problem gets worse
clinton,1, well youre right
clinton,1,race remains a significant challenge in our country
clinton,1,unfortunately race still determines too much often determines where people live determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get and yes it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system
clinton,1,weve just seen those two tragic examples in both tulsa and charlotte
clinton,1, your husband disagrees with you
trump,0, well youre right
trump,0,race remains a significant challenge in our country
trump,0,unfortunately race still determines too much often determines where people live determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get and yes it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system
trump,0,weve just seen those two tragic examples in both tulsa and charlotte
trump,0, your husband disagrees with you
clinton,1,and weve got to do several things at the same time
clinton,1,we have to restore trust between communities and the police
clinton,1,we have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training the best techniques that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary
clinton,1,everyone should be respected by the law and everyone should respect the law
clinton,1, we’ve got to go after the long term health care drivers
clinton,1,weve got to get costs down increase value emphasize wellness
clinton,1,i have a plan for doing that and i think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control but with more resources and smart decisions
clinton,1,and weve got to do several things at the same time
clinton,1,we have to restore trust between communities and the police
clinton,1,we have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training the best techniques that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary
clinton,1,everyone should be respected by the law and everyone should respect the law
clinton,1, we’ve got to go after the long term health care drivers
clinton,1,weve got to get costs down increase value emphasize wellness
clinton,1,i have a plan for doing that and i think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control but with more resources and smart decisions
clinton,1, right now thats not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods
clinton,1,so i have ever since the first day of my campaign called for criminal justice reform
clinton,1,ive laid out a platform that i think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system
clinton,1,but we also have to recognize in addition to the challenges that we face with policing there are so many good brave police officers who equally want reform
clinton,1,so we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal
clinton,1,and weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them
clinton,1,the gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young african american men more than the next nine causes put together
clinton,1, well i would like to say to everyone watching tonight that im reaching out to all americans democrats republicans and independents because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be to grow the economy to make it fairer to make it work for everyone
clinton,1,we need your talents your skills your commitment your energy your ambition
clinton,1,you know ive been privileged to see the presidency up close and i know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you
clinton,1,i have made the cause of children and families really my lifes work
clinton,1,thats what my mission will be in the presidency
clinton,1,i will stand up for families against powerful interests against corporations
clinton,1,i will do everything that i can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes that your kids have good educations from preschool through college
clinton,1,i hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president
clinton,1,and weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them
clinton,1,the gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young african american men more than the next nine causes put together
clinton,1, well i would like to say to everyone watching tonight that im reaching out to all americans democrats republicans and independents because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be to grow the economy to make it fairer to make it work for everyone
clinton,1,we need your talents your skills your commitment your energy your ambition
clinton,1,you know ive been privileged to see the presidency up close and i know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you
clinton,1,i have made the cause of children and families really my lifes work
clinton,1,thats what my mission will be in the presidency
clinton,1,i will stand up for families against powerful interests against corporations
clinton,1,i will do everything that i can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes that your kids have good educations from preschool through college
clinton,1,i hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president
clinton,1,so we have to do two things as i said
clinton,1,we have to restore trust
clinton,1,we have to work with the police
clinton,1,we have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them
clinton,1,and we have to tackle the plague of gun violence which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we’re seeing today
trump,0, shes raising the money from the people she wants to control
trump,0,doesnt work that way
trump,0,but when i started this campaign i started it very strongly
trump,0,its called make america great again
trump,0,were going to make america great
trump,0,we have a depleted military
trump,0,it has to be helped
trump,0,it has to be fixed
trump,0,we have the greatest people on earth in our military
trump,0,we dont take care of our veterans
trump,0,we take care of illegal immigrants people that come into our country illegally better than we take care of our vets
trump,0,that can’t happen
trump,0,our policemen and women are disrespected
trump,0,we need law and order but we need justice too
trump,0,our inner cities are a disaster
trump,0,you get shot walking to the store
trump,0,they have no education
trump,0,they have no jobs
trump,0,i will do more for african americans and latinos that she can do for ten lifetimes
trump,0,all shes done is talk to the african americans and to the latinos but they get the vote and then they come back they say ‘we’ll see you in four years’ we are going to make america strong again and we are going to make america great again and it has to start now
trump,0,we cannot take four more years of barack obama and thats what you get when you get her
trump,0, first of all secretary clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words
trump,0,and thats law and order
trump,0,and we need law and order
trump,0,if we dont have it were not going to have a country
trump,0,and when i look at whats going on in charlotte a city i love city where i have investments when i look at whats going on throughout various parts of our country    i can just keep naming them all day long    we need law and order in our country
trump,0,and i just got today as you know the endorsement of the fraternal order of police it just came in
trump,0,we have endorsements from i think almost every police group very    i mean a large percentage of them in the united states
trump,0,we have a situation where we have our inner cities african americans hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous
trump,0, you walk down the street you get shot
trump,0,in chicago theyve had thousands of shootings thousands since january 1st
trump,0,thousands of shootings
trump,0,and i say where is this
trump,0,is this a war torn country
trump,0,what are we doing
trump,0,and we have to stop the violence we have to bring back law and order in a place like chicago where thousands of people have been killed
trump,0,thousands over the last number of years
trump,0,in fact almost 4000 have been killed since barack obama became president
trump,0,over 4    almost 4000 people in chicago have been killed
trump,0,we have to bring back law and order
trump,0,now whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk which worked very well mayor giuliani is here it worked very well in new york
trump,0,it brought the crime rate way down but you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having it
trump,0,we have gangs roaming the street
trump,0,and in many cases theyre illegally here illegal immigrants
trump,0,and they have guns
trump,0,and they shoot people
trump,0,and we have to be very strong
trump,0,and we have to be very vigilant
trump,0,we have to be    we have to know what were doing
trump,0,right now our police in many cases are afraid to do anything
trump,0,we have to protect our inner cities because african american communities are being decimated by crime
trump,0, no youre wrong
trump,0,it went before a judge who was a very against police judge
trump,0,it was taken away from her and our mayor our new mayor refused to go forward with the case
trump,0,they would have won an appeal
trump,0,if you look at it throughout the country there are many places   
trump,0, no the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn’t have them
trump,0,these are felons these are people that are bad people that shouldnt be    when you have 3000 shootings in chicago from january 1st when you have 4000 people killed in chicago by guns from the beginning of the presidency of barack obama his hometown you have to have stop and frisk
trump,0,you need more police you need a better community you know relation
trump,0,you dont have good community relations in chicago
trump,0,its terrible
trump,0,i have property there
trump,0,its terrible what’s going on in chicago
trump,0,but when when you look    and chicagos not the only    you go to ferguson you go to so many different places
trump,0,you need better relationships    i agree with secretary clinton on this    you need better relationships between the communities and the police
trump,0,because in some cases its not good
trump,0,but you look at dallas where the relationships were really studied the relationships were really a beautiful thing and then five police officers were killed one night very violently
trump,0,so theres some bad things going on
trump,0,some really bad things
trump,0, lester we need law and order
trump,0,we need law and order in the inner cities
trump,0,because the people that are most affected by whats happening are african american and hispanic people
trump,0,and its very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen
clinton,1, well ive heard donald say this at his rallies and its really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country
trump,0, groan
clinton,1, the vibrancy of the black church the black businesses that employ so many people the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids
clinton,1,theres a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up
clinton,1,but we do always have to make sure we keep people safe
clinton,1,there are the right ways of doing it and then there are ways that are ineffective
clinton,1,stop and frisk was found to be unconstitutional and in part because it was ineffective
clinton,1,it did not do what it needed to do
clinton,1,now i believe in community policing and in fact violent crime is one half of what it was in 1991
clinton,1,property crime is down 40 percent
clinton,1,we just dont want to see it creep back up
clinton,1,weve had 25 years of very good cooperation
clinton,1, but there were some problems some unintended consequences
clinton,1,too many young african american and latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses and its just a fact that if youre a young african american man and you do the same thing as a young white man you are more likely to be arrested charged convicted and incarcerated
clinton,1,so weve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system
clinton,1,we cannot just say law and order
clinton,1,we have to say    we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system deal with mandatory minimum sentences which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little
clinton,1,we need to have more second chance programs
clinton,1,im glad that were ending private prisons in the federal system
clinton,1,i want to see them ended in the state system
clinton,1,you shouldnt have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young americans
clinton,1, so there are some positive ways we can work on this
clinton,1,and i believe strongly that common sense gun safety measures would assist us right now and this is something donald has supported along with the gun lobby
clinton,1,right now we’ve got too many military style weapons on the streets in a lot of places our police are outgunned
clinton,1,we need comprehensive background checks and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm
clinton,1,and we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone whos on the terrorist watchlist from being able to buy a gun in our country
clinton,1,if youre too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun
clinton,1,there are things we can do and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way
clinton,1, lester i think implicit bias is a problem for everyone not just police
clinton,1,i think unfortunately too many of us in our great country um jump to conclusions about each other
clinton,1,and therefore i think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about you know why am i feeling this way
clinton,1,but when it comes to policing since it can have literally fatal consequences i have said in my first budget we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers
clinton,1,ive met with a group of very distinguished experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago
clinton,1,they admit its an issue
clinton,1,theyve got a lot of concerns
clinton,1,mental health is one of the biggest concerns because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street
clinton,1,they want support they want more training they want more assistance
clinton,1,and i think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that
trump,0, id like to respond
trump,0, first of all i agree and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no fly lists
trump,0,i agree with you when a person is on a watch list or a no fly list    and i have the endorsement of the nra which im very proud of these are very very good people and they are protecting the second amendment    but i think we have to look very strongly at no fly lists and watch lists and when people are on there even if they shouldnt be on there well help them well help them legally well help them get off
trump,0,but i tend to agree with that quite strongly
trump,0,i do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the word super predator about young black youth
trump,0,thats a term that i think was a    its been horribly met as you know
trump,0,i think you apologized for it
trump,0,but i think it was a terrible thing to say and when it comes to stop and frisk you know youre talking about takes guns away
trump,0,well im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them
trump,0,i dont think    i really dont think you disagree with me on this if you want to know the truth
trump,0,i think theres a political reason why you cant say i really dont believe
trump,0,in new york city stop and frisk we had 2200 murders and stop and frisk brought it down to 500 murders 500 is a lot of murders
trump,0,hard to believe 500 is supposed to be good
trump,0,we went from 2200 to 500 and it was continued on by mayor bloomberg
trump,0,and it was terminated by our current mayor
trump,0,stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city
trump,0,tremendous beyond belief
trump,0,when you say it has no impact it really did it had a very big impact
clinton,1, its also fair to say if were going to talk about mayors that under the current mayor crime has continued to drop including murders
trump,0, youre wrong
clinton,1, no im not
trump,0, murders are up
clinton,1, new york has done an excellent job
clinton,1,i give credit across the board going back two mayors two police chiefs it has worked
clinton,1,and other communities need to come together to do what will work as well
clinton,1,look one murder is too many
clinton,1,but it is important that we learn about what has been effective and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want
clinton,1,who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe
clinton,1,but lets also add no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods
clinton,1,we need to do a better job of working again with the communities faith communities business communities as well as the police to try to deal with this problem
trump,0, id like to responded if i might
trump,0, you look at the inner cities i just left detroit i just left philadelphia
trump,0,youve seen me ive been all over the place
trump,0,you decided to stay home and thats ok
trump,0,i will tell you ive been all over and ive met some of the greatest people ill ever meet within these communities
trump,0,and they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done
clinton,1, i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate
clinton,1,and yes i did
clinton,1,and you know what else i prepared for
clinton,1,i prepared to be president
clinton,1,and i think thats a good thing
clinton,1,applause
trump,0, ill tell you it’s simple to say
trump,0,sidney blumenthal works for the campaign and close    very close friend of secretary clinton
trump,0,and her campaign manager patti doyle went to    during the campaign her campaign against president obama fought very hard and you can go look it up and you can check it out if you look at cnn this past week patti doyle was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened blumenthal sent mcclatchy to kenya to find out about it they were pressing very hard
trump,0,they failed to get the birth certificate
trump,0,when i got involved i didnt fail i got him to give the birth certificate
trump,0,im satisfied with it
trump,0, i want to get on to defeating isis to creating jobs
trump,0,i want to get on to having a strong border
trump,0,i want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country
trump,0, nobody was pressing it nobody was caring much about it
trump,0,i figured youd ask the question tonight of course
trump,0,i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate and i think i did a good job
trump,0,secretary clinton also fought it i mean you know    now everybody in mainstream is going to say thats not true
trump,0,look its true
trump,0,sidney blumenthal sent a reporter    you just have to take a look at cnn the last week the interview with your former campaign manager
trump,0,and she was involved
trump,0,but just like she cant bring back jobs she cant produce
trump,0, well i say nothing because i was able to get him to produce it
trump,0,he should have produced it a long time before
trump,0,i say nothing
trump,0,when you talk about healing i think that ive developed very very good relationships over the last little while with the african american community
trump,0,i think you can see that
trump,0,and i feel like they really wanted me to come to that conclusion and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate
clinton,1, well just listen to what you heard
clinton,1,and clearly as donald just admitted he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage and lester holt was going to be asking us questions he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed
clinton,1,but it cant be dismissed that easily
clinton,1,he has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an american citizen
clinton,1,there was absolutely no evidence for it he persisted he persisted year after year because some of his supporters people that he was trying to bring into his fold apparently believed it or wanted to believe it
clinton,1, but remember
clinton,1,donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the justice department for racial discrimination
clinton,1,because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to african americans and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy
clinton,1,he actually was sued twice by the justice department
clinton,1,so he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior
clinton,1,and the birther lie was a very hurtful one
clinton,1,barack obama is a man of great dignity
clinton,1,and i could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him is that this was being touted and used against him
clinton,1,but i would like to remember what michelle obama said in her amazing speech at our democratic national convention
clinton,1,when they go low we go high
clinton,1,and barack obama went high despite donald trumps best efforts to bring him down
trump,0, i would love to respond
trump,0,first of all i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama
trump,0,you treated him with terrible disrespect and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are    it doesnt work that way
trump,0,you were after him you were trying to    you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb very famous pictures i dont think you can deny that
trump,0,just last week your campaign manager said it was true
trump,0,so when you tried to act holier than thou it really doesnt work
trump,0,as far as the lawsuit yes when i was very young i went into my fathers company
trump,0,we along with many many other companies throughout the country it was a federal lawsuit were sued
trump,0,we settled the suit with zero    no admission of guilt
trump,0,it was very easy to do
trump,0,but they sued many people
trump,0,i notice you bring that up a lot
trump,0,and i also notice the nasty commercials you do on me in so many different ways which i dont do on you
trump,0,maybe im trying to save the money
trump,0,frankly i look at that and i say isnt that amazing
trump,0,i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt but that was a lawsuit brought against many many real estate firms its one of those things
trump,0, ill go one step further
trump,0,in palm beach florida tough community a brilliant community a wealthy community probably the wealthiest community there is in the world i opened a club and really got great credit for it no discrimination against african americans against muslims against anybody
trump,0,and its a tremendously successful club
trump,0,and im so glad i did it and i have been given great credit for what i did
trump,0,and im very very proud of it
trump,0,and thats the way i feel
trump,0,that is the true way i feel
clinton,1, well i think cybersecurity cyberwarfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president because clearly were facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries
clinton,1,there are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money
clinton,1,but increasingly we are seeing cyberattacks coming from states
clinton,1,organs of states
clinton,1,the most recent and troubling of these has been russia
clinton,1,theres no doubt now that russia has used cyberattacks against all kinds of organizations in our country and i am deeply concerned about this
clinton,1,i know donald is very praise    praiseworthy of vladimir putin
clinton,1,but putin is playing a very tough long game here
clinton,1,and one of the things hes done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files to hack into personal files hack into the democratic national committee
clinton,1,and we recently have learned that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information
clinton,1, we need to make it very clear whether its russia china iran or anybody else the united states has much greater capacity
clinton,1,and we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information our private sector information or our public sector information and were going to have to make it clear that we dont want to use the kinds of tools that we have
clinton,1,we dont want to engage in a different kind of warfare
clinton,1,but we will defend the citizens of this country and the russians need to understand that
clinton,1,i think theyve been treating it as almost a probing how far would we go
clinton,1,how much would we do
clinton,1,and thats why i was so i was so shocked when donald publicly invited putin to hack into americans
clinton,1,that is that is just unacceptable
clinton,1,its one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in republican administration   
clinton,1,    have said that donald is unfit to be the commander in chief
clinton,1,its comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face
trump,0, i do want to say that i was just endorsed and more are coming next week it will be over 200 admirals
trump,0,many of them are here admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country
trump,0,that just happened
trump,0,and many more are coming
trump,0,and im very proud of it
trump,0,in addition i was just endorse the by ice
trump,0,they’ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration
trump,0,i was just endorsed by ice
trump,0,i was just recently endorsed 16500 border patrol agents
trump,0,so when secretary clinton talks about this i mean ill take the admirals and i’ll take the generals any day over the political hacks that i see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge
trump,0, because look at the mess that were in
trump,0,look at the mess that were in
trump,0,as far as the cyber i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said we should be better than anybody else and perhaps were not
trump,0,i dont think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc
trump,0,shes saying russia russia russia
trump,0,maybe it was
trump,0,i mean it could be russia but it could also be china but it could also be lots of other people it also could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds ok
trump,0,you dont know who broke into dnc but what did we learn with dnc
trump,0,we learn that bernie sanders was taken advantage of by your people
trump,0,by debbie wasserman schultz
trump,0,look what happened to her
trump,0,but bernie sanders was taken advantage of
trump,0,that’s what it is
trump,0, now whether that was russia whether that was china whether it was another country we dont know because the truth is under president obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over
trump,0,we came in with an internet we came up with the internet
trump,0,and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much when you look at what isis is doing with the internet theyre beating us at our own game
trump,0,isis
trump,0,so we have to get very very tough on cyber and cyber warfare
trump,0,it is a it is a huge problem
trump,0,i have a son
trump,0,hes 10 years old
trump,0,he has computers
trump,0,he is so good with these computers its unbelievable
trump,0,the security aspect of cyber is very very tough
trump,0,and maybe its hardly do able
trump,0,but i will say we are not doing the job we should be doing but thats true throughout our whole governmental society
trump,0,we have so many things that we have to do better lester and certainly cyber is one of them
clinton,1, well i think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing
clinton,1,i have put forth a plan to defeat isis
clinton,1,it does involve going after them online
clinton,1,i think we need do much more with our tech companies to prevent isis and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize even direct people in our country and europe and elsewhere but we also have to intensify our airstrikes against isis and eventually support our arab and kurdish partners to be able to actually take out isis in raqqah and their claim of being a caliphate
clinton,1,were making progress
clinton,1,our military is assisting in iraq
clinton,1,and were hoping that within the year well be able to push isis out of iraq and really squeeze them in syria
clinton,1,but we have to be cognizant of the fact that theyve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them foreign money foreign weapons so we have to make this the top priority
clinton,1,and i would also do everything possible to take out their leadership
clinton,1,i was involved in a number efforts to take out al qaeda leadership when i was secretary of state including of course taking out bin laden and i think we need to go after baghdadi as well make that one of our organizing principles
clinton,1,because weve got to defeat isis and we’ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online
trump,0, first i have to say one thing very important
trump,0,secretary clinton is talking about taking out isis    we will take out isis
trump,0,well president obama and secretary clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of iraq because they got out well they shouldnt have been in but once they got in the way they got out was a disaster
trump,0,and isis was formed
trump,0,so she talks about taking them out    shes been doing it a long time she’s been trying to take them out for a long time
trump,0,shes been trying to take them out for a long time
trump,0,but they wouldnt even have been formed if they left some troops behind
trump,0,like 10000 or maybe something more than that
trump,0,and then you wouldnt have had them
trump,0, or as ive been saying for a long time and i think youll agree because i said it to you once    had we taken the oil and we should have taken the oil isis would not have been able to form either because the oil was their primary source of income
trump,0,and now they have the oil all over the place including the oil a lot of the oil in libya
trump,0,which was another one of her disasters
clinton,1, well i hope the fact checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard
clinton,1,donald supported the invasion of iraq
trump,0, wrong
clinton,1, that is absolutely   
trump,0, wrong
clinton,1, proved over and over again
trump,0, wrong
clinton,1, he actually advocated for the actions we took in libya and urged that gaddafi be taken out after actually doing some business with him one time
clinton,1,but the larger point he says this constantly is george w bush made the agreement about when american troops would leave iraq
clinton,1,not barack obama
clinton,1,and the only way that american troops could have stayed in iraq is to get an agreement from the then iraqi government that would have protected our troops
clinton,1,and the iraqi government would not give that
clinton,1,but lets talk about the question you asked lester
clinton,1,the question you asked is what do we do here in the united states
clinton,1,thats the most important part of this
clinton,1,how do we prevent attacks
clinton,1,how do we protect our people
clinton,1,and i think weve got to have an intelligence surge where we are looking for every scrap of information
clinton,1,i was so proud of law enforcement in new york in minnesota in new jersey you know they responded so quickly so professionally to the attacks that occurred by rahami and they brought him down
clinton,1, and we may find out more information because he is still alive which may prove to be an intelligence benefit
clinton,1,so we’ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from europe from the middle east and that means we have to work more closely with our allies and that’s something that donald has been very dismissive of
clinton,1,were working with nato the longest military alliance in the history of the world to really turn our attention to terrorism
clinton,1,we’re working with our friends in the middle east many of which as you know are muslim majority nations
clinton,1,donald has consistently insulted muslims abroad muslims at home when we need to be cooperating with muslim nations and with the american muslim community
clinton,1,theyre on the front lines
clinton,1,they can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else
clinton,1,they need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities not be alienated and pushed away as some of donald’s rhetoric has unfortunately led to
trump,0, i have to respond
trump,0, the secretary said very strongly about working with weve been working with them for many years and we have the greatest mess anyones ever seen
trump,0,you look at the middle east it’s a total mess
trump,0,under your direction to a large extent
trump,0,but you look at the middle east
trump,0,you started the iran deal
trump,0,thats another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall i mean they were doing so badly they were choking on the sanctions and now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon the way they’re going
trump,0,but when you look at nato i was asked on a major show what do you think of nato
trump,0,you have to understand im a business person i did really well but i have common sense
trump,0,i said well ill tell you i haven’t given lots of thought to nato but two things number 1 the 28 countries of nato many of them aren’t paying their fair share
trump,0,number 2 and that bothers me because we should be yes were defending them they should be at least paying us what they are supposed to be paying by treaty and contract
trump,0, and number two i said and very strongly nato could be obsolete because and i was very strong on this and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times which is unusual for the new york times to be honest but i said they do not focus on terror
trump,0,and i was very strong
trump,0,and i said it numerous times
trump,0,and about four months ago i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division and i think thats great
trump,0,and i think we should get because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of nato
trump,0,its a lot of money to protect other people
trump,0,but im all for nato
trump,0,but i said they have to focus on terror also
trump,0,and theyre going to do that
trump,0,and that was believe me im sure im not going to get credit for it but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato
trump,0,i think we have to get nato to go into the middle east with us
trump,0,in addition to surrounding nations and we have to knock the hell out of isis
trump,0,and we have to it fast
trump,0,when isis formed in this vacuum created by barack obama and secretary clinton and believe me you were the ones that took out the troops
trump,0,not only that you named the day
trump,0,they couldn’t believe it
trump,0,they sat back and 
clinton,1, lester weve covered this ground
trump,0, no wait a minute
trump,0,when they formed when they formed this is something that never should have happened
trump,0,it should never happened
trump,0,now youre talking about taking out isis
trump,0,but you were there and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant
trump,0,now its in over 30 countries and youre going to stop them
trump,0,i dont think so
trump,0, i did not support the war in iraq
trump,0, that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media
trump,0,would you like to hear
trump,0,i was against the war wait a minute
trump,0,i was against the war in iraq
trump,0,just so you put it out
trump,0, it does not show that
trump,0,the record shows that im right
trump,0,when i did an interview with howard stern very lightly the first time anybodys asked me that i said very lightly i don’t know maybe who knows
trump,0,essentially
trump,0,i then did an interview with neil cavuto we talked about the economy it’s more important
trump,0,i then spoke to sean hannity which everybody refuses to call sean hannity
trump,0,i had numerous conversationa with sean hannity at fox
trump,0,and sean hannity said    and he called me the other day and i spoke to him about it and he said you were totally against the war because he was for the war and that was before the war started
trump,0,sean hannity said very strongly to me and other people hes willing to say but nobody wants to call him i was against the war
trump,0,he said you used to have fights with me because sean was in favor of the war
trump,0,and i understand that side also
trump,0,not very much because we should have never been there but nobody called sean hannity
trump,0,and then they did an article in a major magazine shortly after the war started
trump,0,i think in 04
trump,0,but they did an article which had me totally against the war in iraq
trump,0,and one of your compatriots said you know whether it was before or right after trump was definite because if you read this article theres no doubt
trump,0,but if somebody and ill ask the press if somebody would call up sean hannity this was before the war started
trump,0,he and i used to have arguments about the war
trump,0,i said its a terrible and a stupid thing
trump,0,its going to destabilize the middle east
trump,0,and that’s exactly what thiss done
trump,0, you didnt hear what i said
clinton,1, woo okay
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1, lets talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by donald
clinton,1,first nato
clinton,1,nato as a military alliance has something called article v and basically it says this an attack on one is an attack on all
clinton,1,and do you know the only time its ever been invoked after 9 11
clinton,1,when the 28 nations nato said that they would go to afghanistan with us to fight terrorism
clinton,1,something that they still are doing by our side
clinton,1,with respect to iran when i became secretary of state iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb
clinton,1,they had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the bush administration
clinton,1,they had built covert facilities stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away
clinton,1,and we had sanctioned them
clinton,1,i voted for every sanction against iran when i was in the senate but it wasnt enough
clinton,1,so i spent a year and a half putting together a coalition that included russia and china to impose the toughest sanctions on iran and we did drive them to the negotiating table
clinton,1,and my successor john kerry and president obama got a deal that put a lid on irans nuclear program
clinton,1,without firing a single shot
clinton,1,thats diplomacy
clinton,1,thats coalition building
clinton,1,thats working with other nations
clinton,1,the other day i saw donald saying that there were some iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of iran and they were taunting american sailors who were on a nearby ship
clinton,1,he said you know if they taunted our sailors id blow them out of the water and start another war
clinton,1,thats   
trump,0, that would not start a war
clinton,1, thats bad judgment
clinton,1,that is not the right temperament to be commander in chief to be taunted and the worst part   
trump,0, they were taunting us   
clinton,1, the worst part of what i heard donald say has been about nuclear weapons
clinton,1,he has said repeatedly that he didnt care if other countries got nuclear weapon japan south korea even saudi arabia
clinton,1,it has been the policy of the united states democrats and republicans to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons
clinton,1,he even said if there were nuclear war in east asia thats fine you know
trump,0, wrong
clinton,1, have a good time folks
trump,0, thats lies
clinton,1, and in fact his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling
clinton,1,that is the number one threat we face in the world and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material
clinton,1,so a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes
clinton,1,as far as i think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned
trump,0, that line is getting a little bit old i have to say
clinton,1, its a good one though well describes the problem
trump,0, its not an accurate one at all
trump,0,it’s not an accurate one
trump,0,so i just want to give a lot of things and just to respond
trump,0,i agree with her on one thing
trump,0,the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament nuclear weapons
trump,0,not global warming like you think and your president thinks
trump,0,nuclear is the single greatest threat
trump,0,just to go down the list we defend japan
trump,0,we defend germany
trump,0,we defend south korea we defend saudi arabia
trump,0,we defend countries
trump,0,they do not pay us what they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and we’re losing a fortune that’s why we’re losing
trump,0,we’re losing we lose on everything
trump,0,i say who makes these
trump,0,we lose on everything
trump,0,all i said that its very possible that if they dont pay a fair share because this is isnt 40 years ago where we could do what were doing
trump,0,we cant defend japan a behemoth selling us cars by the millions
trump,0, alright but it’s very important
trump,0,all i said is they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out
trump,0,were a country that owes $20 trillion
trump,0,they have to help us out
trump,0,as far as the nuclear is concerned i agree
trump,0,it is the single greatest threat that this country has
trump,0, well i have to say that you know for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia
trump,0,she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries
trump,0,but russia has been expanding their they have a much newer capability than we do
trump,0,we have not been updating from the new standpoint
trump,0,i looked the other night i was seeing b 52s they’re old enough that your father your grandfather could be flying them
trump,0,we are not keeping up with other countries
trump,0,id like everybody to end it just get rid of it but i would certainly not do first strike
trump,0,i think that once the nuclear alternative happens its over
trump,0,at the same time we have to be prepared
trump,0,i cant take anything off the table
trump,0,because you look at some of these countries you look at north korea were doing nothing there
trump,0,china should solve that problem for us
trump,0,china should go into north korea china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea
trump,0, and by the way another one powerful is the worst deal i think ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the iran deal
trump,0,iran is one of their biggest trading partners
trump,0,iran has power over north korea
trump,0,and when they made that horrible deal with iran they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to north korea and they should have done something with respect to yemen and all these other places and when asked to secretary kerry why didnt you do that
trump,0,why didn’t you add other things into the deal
trump,0,one of the great giveaways of all time of all time including $400 million in cash
trump,0,nobodys ever seen that before
trump,0,that turned out to be wrong it was actually $17 billion in cash
trump,0,obviously i guess for the hostages it certainly looks that way
trump,0,so you say to yourself why didnt they make the right deal
trump,0,this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history
trump,0,the deal with iran will lead to nuclear problems all they have to do is sit back 10 years and they dont have to do much
trump,0,and they’re gonna end up getting nuclear
trump,0,i met with bibi netanyahu the other day believe me hes not a happy camper
clinton,1, let me start by saying words matter
clinton,1,words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president
clinton,1,and i want to reassure our allies in japan and south korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them
clinton,1,it is essential that americas word be good
clinton,1,and so i know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe
clinton,1,ive talked with a number of them
clinton,1,but i want to on behalf of myself and i think on behalf of a majority of the american people say that you know our word is good
clinton,1,its also important that we look at the entire global situation
clinton,1,theres no doubt that we have other problems with iran but personally id rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that
clinton,1,and donald never tells you what he would do
clinton,1,would he have started a war
clinton,1,would he have bombed iran
clinton,1,if hes going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to iranian facilities that we never had before then he should tell us what his alternative would be
clinton,1, but its like his plan to defeat isis
clinton,1,he says its a secret plan but the only secret is that he has no plan
clinton,1,so we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues
clinton,1,people around the world follow our presidential campaigns so closely trying to get hints about what we will do
clinton,1,can they rely on us
clinton,1,are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values
clinton,1,thats what i intend to do
clinton,1,i intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on both here at home and around the world to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity but also stand up to bullies whether theyre abroad or at home
clinton,1,we cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with american interests and security   
clinton,1,    if given any opportunities at all
trump,0, lester ne thing id like to say
trump,0, i will be very quickly
trump,0,but i will tell you hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat isis which she could have defeated by never having it you know get going in the first place
trump,0,right now its getting tougher and tougher to defeat them because theyre in more and more places more and more states more and more nations and its a big problem and as far as japan is concerned i want to help all of our allies
trump,0,but we are losing billions and billions of dollars
trump,0,we cannot be the policeman of the world
trump,0,we cannot protect countries all over the world
trump,0, where theyre not paying us what we need
trump,0, she doesn’t say that because she has no business ability
trump,0,we need heart we need a lot of things but you have to have some basic ability
trump,0,and sadly she doesnt have that
trump,0,all of the things that shes talking about could have been taken care of during the last ten years lets say while she had great power but they werent taken care
trump,0,and if she ever wins this race they wont be taken care of
trump,0, she doesnt have the look
trump,0,she doesnt have the stamina
trump,0,i said she doesnt have the stamina and i dont believe she does have the stamina
trump,0,to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina
trump,0, wait a minute lester
trump,0,you asked me a question
trump,0,did you ask me a question
trump,0,you have to be able to negotiate our trade deals
trump,0,you have to be able to negotiate
trump,0,thats right
trump,0,with japan with saudi arabia
trump,0,i mean can you imagine were defending saudi arabia and with all of the money they have were defending them and theyre not paying all you have to do is speak to them
trump,0,wait you have so many different things you have to be able to do and i dont believe that hillary has the stamina
clinton,1, well as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal a cease fire a release of dissidents an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina
trump,0, the world
trump,0,cheers and applause
trump,0, let me tell you
trump,0,let me tell you
trump,0,hillary has experience but its bad experience
trump,0,we have made so many bad deals during the last    so she has experience i agree
trump,0,but its bad bad experience whether its the iran deal that youre so in love with where we gave them $150 billion back
trump,0,whether it’s the iran deal whether it’s uh anything    man you almost cant name a good deal
trump,0,i agree shes got experience but its bad experience
trump,0,and this country cant afford to have another four years of that kind of bad experience
trump,0,cheers and applause
clinton,1, one thing lester
clinton,1,he tried to switch from looks to stamina
clinton,1,but this is a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs
clinton,1,and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers who has said   
trump,0, i never said that
clinton,1, women dont deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men
trump,0, didn’t say that
clinton,1, and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest
clinton,1,he loves beauty contests supporting them and hanging around them
clinton,1,and he called this woman ms piggy
clinton,1,then he called her ms housekeeping because she was latina
clinton,1,donald she has a name
trump,0, where did you find this
trump,0,where did you find this
clinton,1, her name is alicia machado and she has become a us citizen and you can bet shes going to vote this november
trump,0, ok good
trump,0,let me just tell you
trump,0, hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials
trump,0,some of its said in entertainment some of it’s said to somebody whos been very tough to me rosie odonnell
trump,0,i said very tough things to her and i think that everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her
trump,0,but you want to know the truth
trump,0,i was going to say something   
trump,0, extremely rough to hillary to her family and i said to myself i cant do it
trump,0,i just cant do it
trump,0,its inappropriate
trump,0,its not nice
trump,0,but shes spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me many of which are absolutely untrue they’re and theyre misrepresentations and i will tell you this lester its not nice and i dont deserve that but its certainly not a nice thing that shes done
trump,0,it’s hundreds of millions of ads
trump,0,and the only gratifying thing is i saw the polls come in today and with all of that money  
trump,0,    over $200 million spent and im either winning or tied
trump,0,and i’ve spent practically nothing
clinton,1, well i support our democracy
clinton,1,and sometimes you win
clinton,1,sometimes you lose
clinton,1,but i certainly will support the outcome of this election
clinton,1,and i know donalds trying very hard to plant doubts about it but i hope the people out there understand this election’s really up to you
clinton,1,its not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want
clinton,1,so i sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it because it does
trump,0, i want to make america great again
trump,0,we are a nation that is seriously troubled
trump,0,we’re losing our jobs people are pouring into our country
trump,0,the other day we were deporting 800 people
trump,0,and perhaps they pressed the wrong button they press the wrong button or perhaps worse than that it was corruption
trump,0,but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens
trump,0,ended up becoming citizens and it was 800 and now it turns out it might be 1800 and they dont even know
trump,0, i want to make america great again
trump,0,i’m going to be able to do it i don’t think hillary will
trump,0,the answer is if she wins i will absolutely support her
