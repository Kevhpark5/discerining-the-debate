Speaker,Labels,tokenized
o'malley,0,my name is martin omalley former mayor of baltimore former governor of maryland a life long democrat and most importantly a husband and a father
o'malley,0,my wife katie and i have four great kids grace and tara and william and jack
o'malley,0,and like you there is nothing we wouldnt do to give them healthier and better lives
o'malley,0,there are some things that i have learned to do better in life than others
o'malley,0,and after 15 years of executive experience i have learned how to be an effective leader
o'malley,0,whether it was raising the minimum wage making our public schools the best in america passing marriage equality the dream act and comprehensive gun safety legislation i have learned how to get things done because i am very clear about my principals
o'malley,0,thanks to president obama our country has come a long way since the wall street crash of 2008
o'malley,0,our countrys doing better we are creating jobs again
o'malley,0,but we elected a president not a magician and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now
o'malley,0,for there is a — deep injustice an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart and it will not solve itself
o'malley,0,injustice does not solve itself
o'malley,0,what im talking about is this our middle class is shrinking
o'malley,0,our poor families are becoming poorer and 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago
o'malley,0,we need new leadership and we need action
o'malley,0,the sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all american families
o'malley,0,our economy isnt money its people
o'malley,0,its all of our people and so we must invest in our country and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt
o'malley,0,and we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity
o'malley,0,the future is what we make of it
o'malley,0,we are all in this together
o'malley,0,and the question in this election is whether you and i still have the ability to give our kids a better future
o'malley,0,i believe we do that is why i am running for president and i need your help
o'malley,0,thank you
o'malley,0,applause
sanders,0,anderson thank you very much
sanders,0,i think most americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises
sanders,0,the middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing
sanders,0,millions of americans are working longer hours for lower wages and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent
sanders,0,as a result of this disastrous citizens united supreme court decision our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining american democracy
sanders,0,millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super pacs and to elect candidates who represent their interests not the interests of working people
sanders,0,today the scientific community is virtually unanimous climate change is real it is caused by human activity and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren
sanders,0,today in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth
sanders,0,african american youth unemployment is 51 percent
sanders,0,hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent
sanders,0,it seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration maybe — just maybe — we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,what this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have
sanders,0,thank you
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well thank you and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the democratic debates
clinton,1,im hillary clinton
clinton,1,i have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady as a senator from new york and as secretary of state
clinton,1,im the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one year old child
clinton,1,and every day i think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her but for all of our children
clinton,1,i have spent a very long time — my entire adult life — looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead and in particular to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god given potential
clinton,1,ive traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning and ive put forward specific plans about how were going to create more good paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and clean energy by making it possible once again to invest in science and research and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy
clinton,1,at the center of my campaign is how were going to raise wages
clinton,1,yes of course raise the minimum wage but we have to do so much more including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them
clinton,1,and then we have to figure out how were going to make the tax system a fairer one
clinton,1,right now the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much
clinton,1,so i have specific recommendations about how were going to close those loopholes make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share and have a series of tax cuts for middle class families
clinton,1,and i want to do more to help us balance family and work
clinton,1,i believe in equal pay for equal work for women but i also believe its about time we had paid family leave for american families and join the rest of the world
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,during the course of the evening tonight ill have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that ive done behind them
clinton,1,but for me this is about bringing our country together again
clinton,1,and i will do everything i can to heal the divides — the divides economically because theres too much inequality the racial divides the continuing discrimination against the lgbt community — so that we work together and yes finally fathers will be able to say to their daughters you too can grow up to be president
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well actually i have been very consistent
clinton,1,over the course of my entire life i have always fought for the same values and principles but like most human beings — including those of us who run for office — i do absorb new information
clinton,1,i do look at whats happening in the world
clinton,1,you know take the trade deal
clinton,1,i did say when i was secretary of state three years ago that i hoped it would be the gold standard
clinton,1,it was just finally negotiated last week and in looking at it it didnt meet my standards
clinton,1,my standards for more new good jobs for americans for raising wages for americans
clinton,1,and i want to make sure that i can look into the eyes of any middle class american and say this will help raise your wages
clinton,1,and i concluded i could not
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,i think that like most people that i know i have a range of views but they are rooted in my values and my experience
clinton,1,and i dont take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment
clinton,1,you know when i left law school my first job was with the childrens defense fund and for all the years since i have been focused on how were going to un stack the deck and how were gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience i had
clinton,1,you know to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker a father who was a small business person and now asking the people of america to elect me president
clinton,1,im a progressive
clinton,1,but im a progressive who likes to get things done
clinton,1,and i know applause how to find common ground and i know how to stand my ground and i have proved that in every position that ive had even dealing with republicans who never had a good word to say about me honestly
clinton,1,but we found ways to work together on everything from
clinton,1,reforming foster care and adoption to the childrens health insurance program which insures
clinton,1,8 million kids
clinton,1,so i have a long history of getting things done rooted in the same values
clinton,1,ive always had
sanders,0,well were gonna win because first were gonna explain what democratic socialism is
sanders,0,and what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent — almost — own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent
sanders,0,that it is wrong today in a rigged economy that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent
sanders,0,that when you look around the world you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right except the united states
sanders,0,you see every other major country saying to moms that when you have a baby were not gonna separate you from your newborn baby because we are going to have — we are gonna have medical and family paid leave like every other country on earth
sanders,0,those are some of the principles that i believe in and i think we should look to countries like denmark like sweden and norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well first of all lets look at the facts
sanders,0,the facts that are very simple
sanders,0,republicans win when there is a low voter turnout and that is what happened last november
sanders,0,sixty three percent of the american people didnt vote anderson
sanders,0,eighty percent of young people didnt vote
sanders,0,we are bringing out huge turnouts and creating excitement all over this country
sanders,0,democrats at the white house on down will win when there is excitement and a large voter turnout and that is what this campaign is doing
sanders,0,do i consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which wall streets greed and recklessness wrecked this economy
sanders,0,no i dont
sanders,0,i believe in a society where all people do well
sanders,0,not just a handful of billionaires
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well let me just follow up on that anderson because when i think about capitalism i think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families
clinton,1,and i dont think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in america which is save capitalism from itself
clinton,1,and i think what senator sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have
clinton,1,but we are not denmark
clinton,1,i love denmark
clinton,1,we are the united states of america
clinton,1,and its our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesnt run amok and doesnt cause the kind of inequities were seeing in our economic system
clinton,1,but we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history
clinton,1, of the world
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,i think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation
sanders,0,we have got to encourage that
sanders,0,of course we have to support small and medium sized businesses
sanders,0,but you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesnt mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent
sanders,0,so what we need to do is support small and medium sized businesses the backbone of our economy but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake
sanders,0, not just for billionaires
o'malley,0,yes actually i believe what she said was that theres a lot of policies that have led to this unrest
o'malley,0,but anderson when i ran for mayor of baltimore in 1999
o'malley,0,well lets talk about this a little bit
o'malley,0,one of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38 year low in the year prior to the freddie grays tragic death
o'malley,0,anderson when i ran for mayor of baltimore back in 1999 it was not because our city was doing well
o'malley,0,it was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent addicted and abandoned city in america
o'malley,0,and i ran and promised people that together we could turn that around
o'malley,0,and we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime or part one ph crime by more than any other major city in america over the next 10 years
o'malley,0,i did not make our city immune to setbacks
o'malley,0,but i attended a lot of funerals including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor african american neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner
o'malley,0,weve saved over a thousand lives in baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together
o'malley,0,and the vast majority of them were young and poor and black
o'malley,0,it wasnt easy on any day
o'malley,0,but we saved lives and we gave our city a better future improving police and community relations every single day that i was in office
o'malley,0,well i think the key word in your followup there was the word settle
o'malley,0,thats true
o'malley,0,it was settled
o'malley,0,arrests peaked in 2003 anderson but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime
o'malley,0,look none of this is easy
o'malley,0,none of us has all the answers
o'malley,0,but together as a city we saved a lot of lives
o'malley,0,it was about leadership
o'malley,0,it was about principle
o'malley,0,and it was about bringing people together
o'malley,0,thank you
sanders,0,lets begin anderson by understanding that bernie sanders has a d minus voting rating ph from the nra
sanders,0,lets also understand that back in 1988 when i first ran for the united states congress way back then i told the gun owners of the state of vermont and i told the people of the state of vermont a state which has virtually no gun control that i supported a ban on assault weapons
sanders,0,and over the years i have strongly avoided instant background checks doing away with this terrible gun show loophole
sanders,0,and i think weve got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers
sanders,0,also i believe and ive fought for to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal who are homicidal but cant get the healthcare that they need the mental healthcare because they dont have insurance or theyre too poor
sanders,0,i believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately
sanders,0,of course not
sanders,0,this was a large and complicated bill
sanders,0,there were provisions in it that i think made sense
sanders,0,for example do i think that a gun shop in the state of vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody and that somebody goes out and does something crazy that that gun shop owner should be held responsible
sanders,0,i dont
sanders,0,on the other hand where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that of course we should take action
clinton,1,no not at all
clinton,1,i think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence
clinton,1,this has gone on too long and its time the entire country stood up against the nra
clinton,1,the majority of our country applause  supports background checks and even the majority of gun owners do
clinton,1,senator sanders did vote five times against the brady bill
clinton,1,since it was passed more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented
clinton,1,he also did vote as he said for this immunity provision
clinton,1,i voted against it
clinton,1,i was in the senate at the same time
clinton,1,it wasnt that complicated to me
clinton,1,it was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in america
clinton,1,everybody else has to be accountable but not the gun manufacturers
clinton,1,and we need to stand up and say enough of that
clinton,1,were not going to let it continue
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,as a senator from a rural state what i can tell secretary clinton that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what i would hope all of us want and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing
sanders,0,i believe that there is a consensus in this country
sanders,0,a consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks do away with this gun show loophole that we have to address the issue of mental health that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue and that when we develop that consensus we can finally finally do something to address this issue
o'malley,0,and anderson i also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done
o'malley,0,look its fine to talk about all of these things — and im glad were talking about these things — but ive actually done them
o'malley,0,we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said
o'malley,0,we actually did it
o'malley,0,and anderson here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very very real
o'malley,0,sandy and lonnie phillips are here from colorado
o'malley,0,and their daughter jessie was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in aurora
o'malley,0,now to try to transform their grief they went to court where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court but in this case you want to talk about a — a rigged game senator
o'malley,0,the game was rigged
o'malley,0,a man had sold 4000 rounds of military ammunition to this — this person that killed their daughter riddled her body with five bullets and he didnt even ask where it was going
o'malley,0,and not only did their case get thrown out of court they were slapped with $200000 in court fees because of the way that the nra gets its way in our congress and we take a backseat
o'malley,0,its time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation
o'malley,0,applause
sanders,0,i think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and i think we have to take another look at it
sanders,0,but here is the point governor
sanders,0,we can raise our voices but i come from a rural state and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states whether we like it or not
sanders,0,our job is to bring people together around strong commonsense gun legislation
sanders,0,i think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing and i intend to lead the country in bringing our people together
o'malley,0,senator — senator excuse me
o'malley,0,crosstalk
o'malley,0,senator it is not about rural — senator it was not about rural and urban
sanders,0,its exactly about rural
o'malley,0,have you ever been to the eastern shore
o'malley,0,have you ever been to western maryland
o'malley,0,we were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas
sanders,0,governor
o'malley,0,and we did it by leading with principle not by pandering to the nra and backing down to the nra
sanders,0,well as somebody who has a d minus voting record
sanders,0,crosstalk
o'malley,0,and i have an f from the nra senator
sanders,0,i dont think i am pandering
sanders,0,but you have not been in the united states congress
o'malley,0,well maybe thats a healthy thing
o'malley,0,laughter
sanders,0,and when you want to check it out
sanders,0,and if you think — if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together you are sorely mistaken
o'malley,0,anderson when the nra wrote to everyone in our state — when the nra wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is i wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did
o'malley,0,and thats why not only did we pass it but the nra didnt
sanders,0,excuse me
o'malley,0,dare to petition a referendum
sanders,0,i want to make
o'malley,0,because we built a public consensus
clinton,1,well first of all we got a lot of business done with the russians when medvedev was the president and not putin
clinton,1,we got a nuclear arms deal we got the iranian sanctions we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in afghanistan
clinton,1,theres no doubt that when putin came back in and said he was going to be president that did change the relationship
clinton,1,we have to stand up to his bullying and specifically in syria it is important — and i applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the russians to make it clear that theyve got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict
clinton,1,and to — provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of syria at the rate they are
clinton,1,and i think its important too that the united states make it very clear to putin that its not acceptable for him to be in syria creating more chaos bombing people on behalf of assad and we cant do that if we dont take more of a leadership position which is what im advocating
sanders,0,well lets understand that when we talk about syria youre talking about a quagmire in a quagmire
sanders,0,youre talking about groups of people trying to overthrow assad other groups of people fighting isis
sanders,0,youre talking about people who are fighting isis using their guns to overthrow assad and vice versa
sanders,0,im the former chairman of the senate veterans committee and in that capacity i learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war and i will do everything that i can to make sure that the united states does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in iraq the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country
sanders,0,we should be putting together a coalition of arab countries who should be leading the effort
sanders,0,we should be supportive but i do not support american ground troops in syria
clinton,1,well nobody does
clinton,1,nobody does senator sanders
clinton,1,well i recall very well being on a debate stage i think about 25 times with then senator obama debating this very issue
clinton,1,after the election he asked me to become secretary of state
clinton,1,he valued my judgment and i spent a lot of time with him applause in the situation room going over some very difficult issues
clinton,1,you know i — i agree completely
clinton,1,we dont want american troops on the ground in syria
clinton,1,i never said that
clinton,1,what i said was we had to put together a coalition — in fact something that i worked on before i left the state department — to do and yes that it should include arabs people in the region
clinton,1,because what i worry about is what will happen with isis gaining more territory having more reach and frankly posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond
clinton,1,so i think while youre talking about the tough decision that president obama had to make about osama bin laden where i was one of his few advisers or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on iran — i think i have a lot of evidence
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,let me just respond to something the secretary said
sanders,0,first of all she is talking about as i understand it a no fly zone in syria which i think is a very dangerous situation
sanders,0,could lead to real problems
sanders,0,second of all i heard the same evidence from president bush and dick cheney and don rumsfeld about why we should overthrow saddam hussein and get involved in the — i would urge people to go to berniesanderscom hear what i said in 2002
sanders,0,and i say without any joy in my heart that much of what i thought would happen about the destabilization in fact did happen
sanders,0,so i think
sanders,0,i think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here and that is to support those people who are against assad against isis without getting us on the ground there and thats the direction i believe we should have inaudible
sanders,0,well obviously i voted when president clinton said lets stop ethnic cleansing in kosovo i voted for that
sanders,0,i voted to make sure that osama bin laden was held accountable in afghanistan
sanders,0,when our country is threatened or when our allies are threatened i believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country
sanders,0,i do not support the united states getting involved in unilateral action
sanders,0,i dont believe that any
sanders,0,crosstalk
o'malley,0,anderson no president — no commander in chief — should take the military option off the table even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option
o'malley,0,what disturbed people so much about — and i would agree with senator sanders on this — leading us into iraq under false pretenses and telling us as a people that there were weapons of mass destruction there was — was one of the worst blunders in modern american history
o'malley,0,but the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls
o'malley,0,and i remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion
o'malley,0,people were talking at — and saying itll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy and i thought has this world gone mad
o'malley,0,whenever we go — and contrary to john quincy adams advice — searching the world for monsters to destroy and when we use political might to take a — at the expense of democratic principle we hurt ourselves and we hurt our inaudible
o'malley,0,i believe that as president i would not be so quick to pull for a military tool
o'malley,0,i believe that a no fly zone in syria at this time actually secretary would be a mistake
o'malley,0,you have to enforce no fly zones and i believe especially with the russian air force in the air it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret
o'malley,0,i support president obama
o'malley,0,i think we have to play a long game and i think ultimately — you want to talk about blunders
o'malley,0,i think assads invasion of syria will be seen as a blunder
clinton,1,well first of all i
clinton,1,well i am in the middle here and laughter
clinton,1,lots of things coming from all directions
clinton,1,you know i have to say i was very pleased when governor omalley endorsed me for president in 2008 and i enjoyed his strong support in that campaign
clinton,1,and i consider him obviously a friend
clinton,1,let me say — because theres a lot of loose talk going on here — we are already flying in syria just as we are flying in iraq
clinton,1,the president has made a very tough decision
clinton,1,what i believe and why i have advocated that the no fly zone — which of course would be in a coalition — be put on the table is because im trying to figure out what leverage we have to get russia to the table
clinton,1,you know diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution
clinton,1,its about how you balance the risks
clinton,1,and i think we have an opportunity here — and i know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated — to get that leverage to try to get the russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political diplomatic solution in syria
sanders,0,pardon me
sanders,0,well i think mr putin is going to regret what he is doing
sanders,0,i think that when he gets into that
sanders,0,well i think hes already regretting what he did in crimea and what he is doing in the ukraine
sanders,0,i think he is really regretting the decline of his economy
sanders,0,and i think what he is trying to do now is save some face
sanders,0,but i think when russians get killed in syria and when he gets bogged down i think the russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home maybe they should start working with the united states to rectify the situation now
clinton,1,well lets remember what was going on
clinton,1,we had a murderous dictator gadhafi who had american blood on his hands as im sure you remember threatening to massacre large numbers of the libyan people
clinton,1,we had our closest allies in europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide in their words
clinton,1,and we had the arabs standing by our side saying we want you to help us deal with gadhafi
clinton,1,our response which i think was smart power at its best is that the united states will not lead this
clinton,1,we will provide essential unique capabilities that we have but the europeans and the arabs had to be first over the line
clinton,1,we did not put one single american soldier on the ground in libya
clinton,1,and ill say this for the libyan people
clinton,1,but let — ill get to that
clinton,1,but i think its important since i understand senator webbs very strong feelings about this to explain where we were then and to point out that i think president obama made the right decision at the time
clinton,1,and the libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951
clinton,1,and you know what they voted for moderates they voted with the hope of democracy
clinton,1,because of the arab spring because of a lot of other things there was turmoil to be followed
clinton,1,but unless you believe the united states should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous which i do not then when we send them forth there is always the potential for danger and risk
o'malley,0,anderson i think we are learning
o'malley,0,crosstalk
o'malley,0,anderson i think theres lessons to be learned from benghazi
o'malley,0,and those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends
o'malley,0,and i believe thats what chris stevens was trying to do
o'malley,0,but he did not have the tools
o'malley,0,we have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in libya but better decisions in syria today
o'malley,0,and its a huge national security failing
sanders,0,well first of all let me applaud my good friend jim webb for his service to this country in so many ways
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,jim and i under jims leadership as he indicated passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history
sanders,0,we followed suit with a few years later passing under my leadership the most significant veterans health care legislation in the modern history of this country
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,when i was a young man — im not a young man today
sanders,0,when i was a young man i strongly opposed the war in vietnam
sanders,0,not the brave men like jim who fought in that war but the policy which got us involved in that war
sanders,0,that was my view then
sanders,0,cheering and applause
sanders,0,i am not a pacifist anderson
sanders,0,i supported the war in afghanistan
sanders,0,i supported president clintons effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in kosovo
sanders,0,i support air strikes in syria and what the president is trying to do
sanders,0,yes i happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy
sanders,0,but yes i am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary
sanders,0,crosstalk
o'malley,0,i believe that nuclear iran remains the biggest threat along with the threat of isil climate change of course makes cascading threats even more inaudible
clinton,1,i — i think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands
clinton,1,i know the terrorists are constantly seeking it and thats why we have to stay vigilant but also united around the world to prevent that
sanders,0,the scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy the planet that were going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable
sanders,0,that is a major crisis
clinton,1,well ive taken responsibility for it
clinton,1,i did say it was a mistake
clinton,1,what i did was allowed by the state department but it wasnt the best choice
clinton,1,and i have been as transparent as i know to be turning over 55000 pages of my e mails asking that they be made public
clinton,1,and youre right
clinton,1,i am going to be testifying
clinton,1,ive been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public which was not originally agreed to
clinton,1,but lets just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the republican national committee
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,it is a partisan vehicle as admitted by the house republican majority leader mr mccarthy to drive down my poll numbers
clinton,1,big surprise
clinton,1,and thats what they have attempted to do
clinton,1,i am still standing
clinton,1,i am happy to be part of this debate
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and i intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the american people
clinton,1,you know i believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about like how are we going to make college affordable
clinton,1,how are we going to pay down student debt
clinton,1,how are we going to get health care for everybody
clinton,1,crosstalk
clinton,1,well i never said it wasnt legitimate
clinton,1,i said that i have answered all the questions and i will certainly be doing so again before this committee
clinton,1,but i think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture
clinton,1,this committee has spent $45 million of taxpayer money and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like benghazi wouldnt happen again
clinton,1,there were already seven committee reports about what to do
clinton,1,so i think its pretty clear what their obvious goal is
clinton,1,but ill be there
clinton,1,ill answer their questions
clinton,1,but tonight i want to talk not about my e mails but about what the american people want from the next president of the united states
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me say this
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,let me say — let me say something that may not be great politics
sanders,0,but i think the secretary is right and that is that the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e mails
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,thank you
clinton,1,me too
clinton,1,me too
sanders,0,you know
sanders,0,the middle class — anderson and let me say something about the media as well
sanders,0,i go around the country talk to a whole lot of people
sanders,0,middle class in this country is collapsing
sanders,0,we have 27 million people living in poverty
sanders,0,we have massive wealth and income inequality
sanders,0,our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs
sanders,0,the american people want to know whether were going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of citizens union
sanders,0,enough of the e mails
sanders,0,lets talk about the real issues facing america
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,thank you bernie
clinton,1,thank you
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,no
o'malley,0,i believe that now that were finally having debates anderson that we dont have to be defined by the email scandal and how long — what the fbis asking about
o'malley,0,instead we can talk about affordable college making college debt free and all the issues
o'malley,0,which is why — and i see the chair of the dnc here look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table
o'malley,0,we need to get wages to go up college more affordable
o'malley,0,we need to make american 100 percent clean electric by 2050
sanders,0,black lives matter
sanders,0,cheering and the reason — the reason those words matter is the african american community knows that on any given day some innocent person like sandra bland can get into a car and then three days later shes going to end up dead in jail or their kids applause are going to get shot
sanders,0,we need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom and we need major major reforms in a broken criminal justice system applause in which we have more people in jail than china
sanders,0,and i intended to tackle that issue
sanders,0,to make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,anderson the point that the black lives matter movement is making is a very very legitimate and serious point and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives people of color
o'malley,0,when i ran for mayor of baltimore — and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year mostly young and poor and black and i said to our legislature at the time when i appeared in front of them as a mayor that if we were burying white young poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction
o'malley,0,black lives matter and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system and to address race relations in our country
o'malley,0,applause
clinton,1,well i think that president obama has been a great moral leader on these issues and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the republicans at every turn so applause so what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice — i have talked about that at some length including things like body cameras but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that president obama empanelled on policing
clinton,1,there is an agenda there that we need to be following up on
clinton,1,similarly we need to tackle mass incarceration and this may be the only bi partisan issue in the congress this year
clinton,1,we actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world
clinton,1,but i believe that the debate and the discussion has to go further anderson because weve got to do more about the lives of these children
clinton,1,thats why i started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential
clinton,1,that is
clinton,1,really hard to do if you dont have early childhood education
clinton,1,if you dont have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people or good housing theres a long list applause we need a new new deal for communities of color
sanders,0,well first of all lets remember where we were when bush left office
sanders,0,we were losing 800000 jobs a month
sanders,0,and i know my republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue but the worlds financial crisis was on — the worlds financial markets system was on the verge of collapse
sanders,0,thats where we were
sanders,0,are we better off today than we were then
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,but the truth is that for the 40 years the great middle class of this country has been disappearing
sanders,0,and in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour pay equity for women workers and our disastrous trade policies which have cost us millions of jobs and make every public college and university in this country tuition free
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well you know both bill and i have been very blessed
clinton,1,neither of us came from wealthy families and weve worked really hard our entire lives
clinton,1,and i want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and i have had to make the most of their god given potential and to have the chances that they should have in america for a good education good job training and then good jobs
clinton,1,i have a five point economic plan because this inequality challenge we face we have faced it at other points
clinton,1,its absolutely right
clinton,1,it hasnt been this bad since the 1920s
clinton,1,but if you look at the republicans versus the democrats when it comes to economic policy there is no comparison
clinton,1,the economy does better when you have a democrat in the white house and thats why we need to have a democrat in the white house in january 2017
o'malley,0,yes
o'malley,0,anderson i want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from vermont mentioned and i actually did them in our state
o'malley,0,we raised the minimum wage passed the living wage invested more in infrastructure went four years in a row without a pennys increase in college tuition
o'malley,0,but theres another piece that senator sanders left out tonight but hes been excellent about underscoring that
o'malley,0,and that is that we need to separate the casino speculative mega bank gambling that we have to insure with our money from the commercial banking — namely reinstating glass steagall
o'malley,0,secretary clinton mentioned my support eight years ago
o'malley,0,and secretary i was proud to support you eight years ago but something happened in between and that is anderson a wall street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families
o'malley,0,and we are still just as vulnerable paul volcker says today
o'malley,0,we need to reinstate glass steagall and thats a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates
clinton,1,well my plan is more comprehensive
clinton,1,and frankly its tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail
clinton,1,we can never let the american taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw
clinton,1,but we also have to worry about some of the other players — aig a big insurance company lehman brothers an investment bank
clinton,1,theres this whole area called shadow banking
clinton,1,thats where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from
clinton,1,so im with both senator sanders and governor omalley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks
clinton,1,and the plan that i have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk
clinton,1,but i want to make sure were going to cover everybody not what caused the problem last time but what could cause it next time
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,well thats not true
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street where fraud is a business model helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,check the record
sanders,0,in the 1990s — and all due respect — in the 1990s when i had the republican leadership and wall street spending billions of dollars in lobbying when the clinton administration when alan greenspan said what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge bernie sanders fought them and helped lead the opposition to deregulation
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,today it is my view that when you have the three
sanders,0,largest banks in america — are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail we have got to break them up
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,yeah
clinton,1,you know i — i respect the passion an intensity
clinton,1,i represented wall street as a senator from new york and i went to wall street in december of 2007 — before the big crash that we had — and i basically said cut it out
clinton,1,quit foreclosing on homes
clinton,1,quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors
clinton,1,i took on the bush administration for the same thing
clinton,1,so i have thought deeply and long about what were gonna do to do exactly what i think both the senator and the governor want which is to rein in and stop this risk
clinton,1,and my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail
clinton,1,nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid applause
clinton,1,and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks
clinton,1,but im telling you — i will say it tonight
clinton,1,if only you look at the big banks you may be missing the forest for the trees
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,i will just a second
sanders,0,ill tell him
sanders,0,in my view secretary clinton you do not — congress does not regulate wall street
sanders,0,wall street regulates congress
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and we have gotta break off these banks
sanders,0,going to them
clinton,1,so
sanders,0,and saying please do the right thing
clinton,1,no thats not what
sanders,0,is kind of naive
clinton,1,that — i think dodd frank was a very
clinton,1,good start and i think that we have to implement it
clinton,1,we have to prevent the republicans from ripping it apart
clinton,1,we have to save the consumer financial protection board which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,we have work to do
clinton,1,youve got no argument from me
clinton,1,but i know if we dont come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach like the plan im recommending were gonna be behind instead of ahead
clinton,1,on what the next crisis could be
o'malley,0,anderson look this is — the big banks — i mean once we repealed glass steagall back in the late 1999s ph the big banks the six of them went from controlling what the equivalent of 15 percent of our gdp to now 65 percent of our gdp
o'malley,0,and — inaudible right before this debate secretary clintons campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on keystone and many other things
o'malley,0,but one of them that we still have a great difference on madam secretary is that you are not for glass steagall
o'malley,0,you are not for putting a firewall between this speculative risky shadow banking behavior
o'malley,0,i am and the people of our country need a president whos on their side willing to protect the main street economy from recklessness on wall street
o'malley,0,we have to fulfill
o'malley,0,our promise
clinton,1,well you know everybody on this stage has changed a position or two
clinton,1,weve been around a cumulative quite some period of time
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1,you know we know that if you are learning youre gonna change your position
clinton,1,i never took a position on keystone until i took a position on keystone
clinton,1,but i have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change starting in 2009 when president obama and i crashed ph a meeting with the chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that theyd ever joined
clinton,1,so im
clinton,1,not taking a back seat to anybody on my values
clinton,1,my principles and the results that i get
sanders,0,well i remember that meeting very well
sanders,0,i remember it like it was yesterday
sanders,0,hank paulson bernanke came in and they say guys the economy is going to collapse because wall street is going under
sanders,0,its gonna take the economy with them
sanders,0,and you know what i said to hank paulson
sanders,0,i said hank your guys — you come from goldman sachs
sanders,0,your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem
sanders,0,how about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout not working families in this country
sanders,0,so to answer your question no i would not have let the economy collapse
sanders,0,but it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out wall street
sanders,0,and by the way i want wall street now to help kids in this country go to college public colleges and universities free with a wall street speculation tax
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well let me tell you donald trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today — taxes in the future than theyre paying today
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,but in terms of education this is what i think
sanders,0,this is the year 2015
sanders,0,a college degree today dana is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago
sanders,0,and what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family
sanders,0,i think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college
sanders,0,i think we dont need a complicated system which the secretary is talking about the income goes down the income goes down if youre poor you have to work and so forth and so on
sanders,0,i pay for my program by the way through a tax on wall street speculation which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition free it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt a major crisis in this country
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well let me address college affordability because i have a plan that i think will really zero in on what the problems are
clinton,1,first all the 40 million americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate
clinton,1,that will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome burdensome college debt
clinton,1,as a young student in nevada said to me the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it
clinton,1,so then we have to make it more affordable
clinton,1,how do we make it more affordable
clinton,1,my plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free
clinton,1,you would not have to borrow money for tuition
clinton,1,but i do believe — and maybe its because i worked when i went through college i worked when i went through law school — i think its important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished
clinton,1,thats why i call it a compact
clinton,1,but yes i would like students to work 10 hours a week
sanders,0, in order to make it possible for them to afford their education
sanders,0,and i want colleges to get their costs down
sanders,0,they are outrageously high in what theyre charging
clinton,1,well i fully support social security
clinton,1,and the most important fight were going to have is defending it against continuing republican efforts to privatize it
clinton,1,i want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of social security
clinton,1,we have a lot of women on social security particularly widowed and single women who didnt make a lot of money during their careers and they are impoverished and they need more help from the social security system
clinton,1,and i will focus — i will focus on helping those people who need it the most
clinton,1,and of course im going to defend social security
clinton,1,im going to look for ways to try to make sure its solvent into the future
clinton,1,and we also need to talk about health care at some time because we agree on the goals we just disagree on the means
sanders,0,when the republicans — when the republicans in the congress and some democrats were talking about cutting social security and benefits for disabled veterans for the so called chained cpi i founded a caucus called the defending social security caucus
sanders,0,my view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by — and i dont know how they do on $11000 $12000 $13000 a year — you dont cut social security you expand it
sanders,0,and the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118000
sanders,0,you do that social security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits
sanders,0,crosstalk
sanders,0,i didnt leave anybody at the altar
sanders,0,i voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest worker provisions in it which the southern poverty law center talked about being semi slavery
sanders,0,guest workers are coming in theyre working under terrible conditions but if they stand up for their rights theyre thrown out of the country
sanders,0,i was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason
sanders,0,tom harkin a very good friend of hillary clintons and mine one of the leading labor advocates also voted against that
sanders,0,i know that
sanders,0,but point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason
sanders,0,my view right now — and always has been — is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country we need comprehensive immigration reform we need a path toward citizenship we need to take people out of the shadows
o'malley,0,and juan carlos — juan carlos
clinton,1,well first of all i want to make sure every child gets health care
clinton,1,thats why i helped to create the childrens health insurance program and i want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others
clinton,1,i want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the affordable care act
clinton,1,i think to go beyond that as i understand what governor omalley has recommended so that they would get the same subsidies
clinton,1,i think that is — it raises so many issues
clinton,1,it would be very difficult to administer it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform when we finally do get to it
o'malley,0,juan carlos i think what youve heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform and thats why its gridlocked
o'malley,0,we need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new american immigrants
o'malley,0,that is why i have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform that is why i would go further than president obama has on daca and dapa
o'malley,0,i mean we are a nation of immigrants we are made stronger by immigrants
o'malley,0,do you think for a second that simply because somebodys standing in a broken que on naturalization theyre not going to go to the hospital and that care isnt going to fall on to our insurance rates
o'malley,0,i am for a generous compassionate america that says were all in this together
o'malley,0,we need comprehensive
o'malley,0,immigration reform
o'malley,0,itll make wages go up in america $250 for every year
clinton,1,i want to follow up because i think underneath juan carlos important questions there is such a difference between everything youre hearing here on this stage and what we hear from the republicans
clinton,1,applause
o'malley,0,here
o'malley,0,here
o'malley,0,cheering applause
clinton,1,demonize hard working immigrants who have insulted them
clinton,1,you know i came to las vegas in i think may
clinton,1,early may
clinton,1,met with a group of dreamers i wish everybody in america could meet with this young people to hear their stories to know their incredible talent their determination and thats why i would go further
clinton,1,than even the executive orders that president obama has signed when im president
clinton,1,cross talk
clinton,1,my plan would support any state that takes that position and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing
clinton,1,if their states agree then we want more states to do the same thing
o'malley,0,anderson we actually did this in my state of maryland
o'malley,0,we passed applause
o'malley,0,we passed a state version of the dream act
o'malley,0,cheering
o'malley,0,and a lot of the xenophobes the immigrant haters like some that weve heard like donald trump that carnival barker in the republican party
o'malley,0,cheering applause
o'malley,0,tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants
o'malley,0,but we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum and we won with 58 percent of the vote
o'malley,0,the more our children learn the more they will earn and thats true of children who have yet to be naturalized
o'malley,0,but will become american citizens
sanders,0,well i was chairman for two years and when i was chairman we did take action
sanders,0,what we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many many new doctors and nurses into the va
sanders,0,so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it and not be on long waiting lines
sanders,0,and the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a va
sanders,0,facility that veteran could get health care from the community health center or the private sector
sanders,0,as a result of that legislation we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them
clinton,1,no i dont
clinton,1,i think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9 11 to put in place the security that we needed
clinton,1,and it is true that it did require that there be a process
clinton,1,what happened however is that the bush administration began to chip away at that process
clinton,1,and i began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in
clinton,1,we always have to keep the balance of civil liberties privacy and security
clinton,1,its not easy in a democracy but we have to keep it in mind
sanders,0,it was 99 to one and i was maybe the one
sanders,0,i dont know
sanders,0,im sorry
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,of course
sanders,0,well i would shut down — make — id shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the nsa
sanders,0,that is unacceptable to me
sanders,0,but its not just government surveillance
sanders,0,i think the government is involved in our e mails is involved in our websites
sanders,0,corporate america is doing it as well
sanders,0,if we are a free country we have the right to be free
sanders,0,yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights
sanders,0,omalley 
sanders,0, anderson the nsa
clinton,1,he broke the laws of the united states
clinton,1,he could have been a whistleblower
clinton,1,he could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower
clinton,1,he could have raised all the issues that he has raised
clinton,1,and i think there would have been a positive response to that
o'malley,0,anderson snowden put a lot of americans lives at risk
o'malley,0,snowden broke the law
o'malley,0,whistleblowers do not run to russia and try to get protection from putin
o'malley,0,if he really believes that he should be back here
sanders,0,i think snowden played a very important role in educating the american people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined
sanders,0,he did — he did break the law and i think there should be a penalty to that
sanders,0,but i think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is inaudible
o'malley,0,i would follow through on the promise that the american people thought we made as democratic party to protect the main street economy from recklessness on wall street
o'malley,0,i would push to separate out these too big to jail too big to fail banks and put in place glass steagall a modern glass steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again
clinton,1,well i think thats pretty obvious
clinton,1,i think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents weve had up until this point including president obama
clinton,1,well theres a lot that i would like to do to build on the successes of president obama but also as im laying out to go beyond
clinton,1,and thats in my economic plans how i would deal with the prescription drug companies how i would deal with college how i would deal with a full range of issues that ive been talking about throughout this campaign to go further
sanders,0,i have a lot of respect for president obama
sanders,0,i have worked with him time and time again on many many issues
sanders,0,but heres where i do disagree
sanders,0,i believe that the power of corporate america the power of wall street the power of the drug companies the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform america and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say our government is going to work for all of us not just a handful of billionaires
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,what i mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world not one of the lowest
sanders,0,we need to raise public consciousness
sanders,0,we need the american people to know whats going on in washington in a way that today they do not know
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest then we could bring the kind of change we need
o'malley,0,anderson i actually have talked about a revolution
o'malley,0,what we need is a green energy revolution
o'malley,0,we need to move america to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way
clinton,1,well thank you
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1,you know it does take me a little longer
clinton,1,thats all i can say
clinton,1,well i cant think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president but im not just running because i would be the first woman president
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,im running because i have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people fighting for kids for women for families fighting to even the odds
clinton,1,and i know what it takes to get things done
clinton,1,i know how to find common ground and i know how to stand my ground
clinton,1,and i think were going to need both of those in washington to get anything that were talking about up here accomplished
clinton,1,so im very happy that i have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the american people
o'malley,0,well actually you know we had this conversation
o'malley,0,and i will share with you that ive traveled all around the country anderson and theres two phrases i keep hearing again and again and again
o'malley,0,and theyre the phrases new leadership and getting things done
o'malley,0,we cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward
o'malley,0,i respect what secretary clinton and her husband have done for our country
o'malley,0,but our country needs new leadership to move forward
clinton,1,well i would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name
clinton,1,i would ask them to listen to what im proposing look at what ive accomplished in the senate as secretary of of state and then draw your own conclusion
clinton,1,i certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is clinton
clinton,1,im campaigning because i think i have the right combination of what the country needs at this point and i think i can take the fight to the republicans because we cannot afford a republican to succeed barack obama as president of the united states
sanders,0,i think — i think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics
sanders,0,i am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire who has raised substantial sums of money and i do not have a super pac
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires and in fact tonight in terms of what a political revolution is about there are 4000 house parties — 100000 people in this country — watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country
o'malley,0,yeah
o'malley,0,anna i have put forward a plan — and im the only candidate i believe in either party to do this — to move america forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050
o'malley,0,we did not land a man on the moon with an all of the above strategy
o'malley,0,it was an intentional engineering challenge and we solved it as a nation
o'malley,0,and our nation must solve this one
o'malley,0,so i put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind
o'malley,0,if you go across iowa you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind
o'malley,0,were here in las vegas one of the most sustainable cities in america doing important things in terms of green building architecture and design
o'malley,0,we can get there as a nation but its going to require presidential leadership
o'malley,0,and as president i intend to sign as my very first order in office the — an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050
o'malley,0,we can do it
sanders,0,well i will tell you this
sanders,0,i believe — and pope francis made this point
sanders,0,this is a moral issue
sanders,0,the scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly
sanders,0,i am proud that along with senator barbara boxer a few years ago we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon
sanders,0,and let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform because the fossil fuel industry is funding the republican party which denies the reality of climate change applause
sanders,0,and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively
sanders,0,this is a moral issue
sanders,0,we have got to be extremely aggressive in working with china india russia
sanders,0,the planet — the future of the planet is at stake
clinton,1,well that — thats exactly what ive been doing
clinton,1,when we met in copenhagen in 2009 and literally president obama and i were hunting for the chinese going throughout this huge convention center because we knew we had to get them to agree to something
clinton,1,because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless china and india join with the rest of the world
clinton,1,they told us theyd left for the airport we found out they were having a secret meeting
clinton,1,we marched up we broke in we said weve been looking all over for you
clinton,1,lets sit down and talk about what we need to do
clinton,1,and we did come up with the first international agreement that china has signed
clinton,1,thanks to president obamas leadership its now gone much further
clinton,1,and i do think that the bilateral agreement that president obama made with the chinese was significant
clinton,1,now it needs to go further and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there
clinton,1,mm hmm
clinton,1,well im surprised she says that because california has had a paid leave program for a number of years
clinton,1,and its
clinton,1,well but all — well on a state level a state as big as many countries in the world
clinton,1,and it has not had the ill effects that the republicans are always saying it will have
clinton,1,and i think this is — this is typical republican scare tactics
clinton,1,we can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses
clinton,1,i remember as a young mother you know having a baby wake up who was sick and im supposed to be in court because i was practicing law
clinton,1,i know what its like
clinton,1,and i think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face particularly working moms
clinton,1,i see my good friend senator gillibrand in the front row
clinton,1,shes been a champion of this
clinton,1,we need to get a consensus through this campaign which is why im talking about it everywhere i go and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it
clinton,1,well look you know when people say that — its always the republicans or their sympathizers who say you cant have paid leave you cant provide health care
clinton,1,they dont mind having big government to interfere with a womans right to choose and to try to take down planned parenthood
clinton,1,theyre fine with big government when it comes to that
clinton,1,im sick of it
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,you know we can do these things
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,we should not be paralyzed — we should not be paralyzed by the republicans and their constant refrain big government this big government that that except for what they want to impose on the american people
clinton,1,i know we can afford it because were going to make the wealthy pay for it
clinton,1,that is the way to get it done
sanders,0,yeah dana heres the point every other major country on earth every one including some small countries say that when a mother has a baby she should stay home with that baby
sanders,0,we are the only major country
sanders,0,that is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family — paid family and medical leave
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,second of all the secretary is right
sanders,0,republicans tell us we cant do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut social security medicare and medicaid
sanders,0,thats not what the american people want
o'malley,0,anderson in our state we actually expanded family leave
o'malley,0,and i have to agree with secretary clinton and senator sanders
o'malley,0,look the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country and we need to do that for our families and especially so that women arent penalized in having to drop out of the workforce
o'malley,0,my wife katie is here with our four kids
o'malley,0,and man that was a juggle when we had little kids and — and keeping jobs and moving forwards
o'malley,0,we would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave
sanders,0,i suspect i would vote yes
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i would vote yes because i am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non violent offenses
sanders,0,we have a criminal justice system that lets ceos on wall street walk away and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana
sanders,0,i think we have to think through this war on drugs applause which has done an enormous amount of damage
sanders,0,we need to rethink our criminal justice system we weve got a lot of work to do in that area
o'malley,0,juan carlos
o'malley,0,applause
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,i think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today
clinton,1,i do support the use of medical marijuana and i think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how were going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief
clinton,1,so i think were just at the beginning but i agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana
clinton,1,therefore we need more states cities and the federal government to begin to address this so that we dont have this terrible result that senator sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent low level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana
sanders,0,the republican party since ive been in the senate and since president obama has been in office has played a terrible terrible role of being total obstructionists
sanders,0,every effort that he has made that some of us have made they have said no no no
sanders,0,now in my view the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are by the way i hope will not continue to control the senate and the house when one of us elected president applause but the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together
sanders,0,if we want free tuition at public colleges and universities millions of young people are going to have to demand it and give the republicans an offer they cant refuse
sanders,0,if we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour workers are going to have to come together and look the republicans in the eye and say we know whats going on
sanders,0,you vote against us you are out of your job
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,the national rifle association
o'malley,0,applause
clinton,1,well in addition to the nra the health insurance companies the drug companies the iranians
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1,probably the republicans
clinton,1,laughter and applause
sanders,0,as someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in washington i would lump wall street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,anderson thank you
o'malley,0,i am very very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight
o'malley,0,and what you heard tonight anderson was a very very — and all of you watching at home — was a very very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential republican debates
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,on this stage — on this stage you didnt hear anyone denigrate women you didnt hear anyone make racist comments about new american immigrants you didnt hear anyone speak ill of another american because of their religious belief
o'malley,0,what you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 to take the actions that we have always taken as americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country employ more of our people rebuild our cities and towns educate our children at higher and better levels and include more of our people in the economic social and political life of our country
o'malley,0,i truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of american progress
o'malley,0,unless youve become discouraged about our gridlock in congress talk to our young people under 30 because youll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,that tells me we are moving to a more connected generous and compassionate place and we need to speak to the goodness within our country
o'malley,0,applause
sanders,0,this is a great country but we have many many serious problems
sanders,0,we should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country
sanders,0,we should not be the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and — and parental leave — family and parental leave to all of our families
sanders,0,now at the end of our day here is the truth that very few candidates will say is that nobody up here certainly no republican can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life
sanders,0,jim webb is right money is pouring in to this campaign through super pacs
sanders,0,we are doing it the old fashioned way 650000 individual contributions
sanders,0,and if people want to help us out berniesanderscom
sanders,0,we are averaging $30 bucks apiece
sanders,0,we would appreciate your help
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,thank you very much anderson
clinton,1,and thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight
clinton,1,i think what you did see is that in this debate we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country
clinton,1,thats in stark contrast to the republicans who are currently running for president
clinton,1,what you have to ask yourself is who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the american people
clinton,1,who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done
clinton,1,now i revere my late mother and she gave me a lot of good advice
clinton,1,but one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was you know the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down
clinton,1,its whether you get back up
clinton,1,americas been knocked down
clinton,1,that great recession 9 million people lost their jobs 5 million lost their homes $13 trillion in wealth disappeared
clinton,1,and although weve made progress were standing but not running the way america needs to
clinton,1,my mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard working middle class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain i was raised with if you work hard and you do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead
clinton,1,please join me in this campaign
clinton,1,please come and make it clear that americas best days are still ahead
clinton,1,thank you very much
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,sanders well john let me concur with you and with all americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in paris yesterday
sanders,0,together leading the world this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called isis
sanders,0,im running for president because as i go around this nation i talk to a lot of people
sanders,0,and what i hear is peoples concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy
sanders,0,people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent
sanders,0,and then on top of that weve got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super pacs heavily influencing the political process
sanders,0,what my campaign is about is a political revolution    millions of people standing up and saying enough is enough
sanders,0,our government belongs to all of us and not just the hand full of billionaires
clinton,1,well our prayers are with the people of france tonight but that is not enough
clinton,1,we need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like isis a barbaric ruthless violent jihadist terrorist group
clinton,1,this election is not only about electing a president
clinton,1,its also about choosing our next commander in chief
clinton,1,and i will be laying out in detail what i think we need to do with our friends and allies in europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism
clinton,1,our country deserves no less because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong
o'malley,0,my heart like all of us in this room john and all the people across our country my hearts go out to the people of france in this moment of loss
o'malley,0,parents and sons and daughters and family members and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them we must remember this that this isnt the new face of conflict and warfare not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century
o'malley,0,and there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation
o'malley,0,we must able to work collaboratively with others
o'malley,0,we must anticipate these threats before they happen
o'malley,0,this is the new sort of challenge the new sort of threat that does in fact require new thinking fresh approaches and new leadership
o'malley,0,as a former mayor and a former governor there was never a single day john when i went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country
o'malley,0,we have a lot of work to do to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century
clinton,1,well john i think that we have to look at isis as the leading threat of an international terror network
clinton,1,it cannot be contained it must be defeated
clinton,1,there is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal not just military force which should be used as a last resort but our diplomacy our development aid law enforcement sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way    that we can bring people together
clinton,1,but it cannot be an american fight
clinton,1,and i think what the president has consistently said   which i agree with   is that we will support those who take the fight to isis
clinton,1,that is why we have troops in iraq that are helping to train and build back up the iraqi military why we have special operators in syria working with the kurds and arabs so that we can be supportive
clinton,1,but this cannot be an american fight although american leadership is essential
clinton,1,well john look i think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that george w bush made with the iraqis to leave by 2011 is that an iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend iraq
clinton,1,unfortunately nouri al maliki the prime minister set about decimating it
clinton,1,and then with the revolution against assad    and i did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with assad because i thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum
clinton,1,so yes this has developed
clinton,1,i think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region but i dont think that the united states has the bulk of the responsibility
clinton,1,i really put that on assad and on the iraqis and on the region itself
o'malley,0,john i would disagree with secretary clinton respectfully on this score
o'malley,0,this actually is americas fight
o'malley,0,it cannot solely be americas fight
o'malley,0,america is best when we work in collaboration with our allies
o'malley,0,america is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world
o'malley,0,and isis make no mistake about it is an evil in this world
o'malley,0,isis has brought down a russian airliner
o'malley,0,isis has now attacked a western democracy in    in france
o'malley,0,and we do have a role in this
o'malley,0,not solely ours but we must work collaboratively with other nations
o'malley,0,the great failing of these last 10 or 15 years john has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground
o'malley,0,our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple
o'malley,0,our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope
o'malley,0,make ourselves stronger at home but also our role in the world yes is also to confront evil when it rises
o'malley,0,we took out the safe haven in afghanistan but now there is undoubtedly a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are
sanders,0,sanders absolutely
sanders,0,in fact climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism
sanders,0,and if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say youre going to see countries all over the world    this is what the cia says    theyre going to be struggling over limited amounts of water limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask youre going to see all kinds of international conflict
sanders,0,but of course international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today
sanders,0,and i agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said
sanders,0,but let me have one area of disagreement with the secretary
sanders,0,i think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours
sanders,0,well in fact i would argue that the disastrous invasion of iraq something that i strongly opposed has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al qaeda and to isis
sanders,0,now in fact what we have got to do    and i think there is widespread agreement here    is the united states cannot do it alone
sanders,0,what we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life
sanders,0,sanders i dont think any    i dont think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now
sanders,0,i think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the united states
clinton,1,thank you john
clinton,1,well thank you john
clinton,1,i think its important we put this in historic context
clinton,1,the united states has unfortunately been victimized by terrorism going back decades
clinton,1,in the 1980s it was in beirut lebanon under president reagans administration and 258 americans marines embassy personnel and others were murdered
clinton,1,we also had attacks on two of our embassies in tanzania kenya when my husband was president
clinton,1,again americans murdered
clinton,1,and then of course 9 11 happened which happened before there was an invasion of iraq
clinton,1,i have said the invasion of iraq was a mistake
clinton,1,but i think if were ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it
sanders,0,sanders i think we have a disagreement and the disagreement is that not only did i vote against the war in iraq
sanders,0,if you look at history john you will find that regime change    whether it was in the early 50s in iran whether it was toppling salvador allende in chile whether it is overthrowing the government of guatemala way back when    these invasions these toppling of governments regime changes have unintended consequences
sanders,0,i would say that on this issue im a little bit more conservative than the secretary
sanders,0,sanders  and that i am not a great fan of regime change
o'malley,0,john may i    may i interject here
o'malley,0,secretary clinton also said we    it was not just the invasion of iraq which secretary clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake    and indeed it was
o'malley,0,but it was also the cascading effects that followed that
o'malley,0,it was also the disbanding of many elements of the iraqi army that are now showing up as part of isis
o'malley,0,it was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up
o'malley,0,we need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of    of nation state failures and conflict
o'malley,0,its not just about getting rid of a single dictator
o'malley,0,it is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next
clinton,1,well of course each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed
clinton,1,part of the problem that we have currently in the middle east is that assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of russia and iran and with the proxy of hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles
clinton,1,so i dont think you can paint with a broad brush
clinton,1,this is an incredibly complicated region of the world
clinton,1,its become more complicated
clinton,1,and many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the united states has either started or have a role in
clinton,1,the shia sunni split
clinton,1,the dictatorships have suppressed peoples aspirations
clinton,1,the increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life
clinton,1,we saw that in egypt
clinton,1,we saw a dictator overthrown
clinton,1,we saw a muslim brotherhood president installed and then we saw him ousted and the army back
clinton,1,so i think weve got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the middle east
sanders,0,sanders the secretarys obviously right
sanders,0,it is enormously complicated
sanders,0,but heres something that i believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition and that is we have to understand that the muslim nations in the region    saudi arabia iran turkey jordan    all of these nations theyre going to have to get their hands dirty their boots on the ground
sanders,0,they are going to have to take on isis
sanders,0,this is a war for the soul of islam
sanders,0,and those countries who are opposed to islam they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today
sanders,0,we should be supportive of that effort
sanders,0,so should the uk so should france
sanders,0,but those muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort
sanders,0,they are not doing it now
clinton,1,well i think    i think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned most particularly jordan which has put a lot on the line for the united states has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from syria and has been therefore subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves
clinton,1,i do agree that in particular turkey and the gulf nations have got to make up their minds
clinton,1,are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not
clinton,1,and there are many ways of doing it
clinton,1,they can provide forces
clinton,1,they can provide resources
clinton,1,but they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand
clinton,1,well we did have a plan and i think its fair to say that of all of the arab leaders gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of americans than anybody else
clinton,1,and when he moved on his own people threatening a massacre genocide the europeans and the arabs our allies and partners did ask for american help and we provided it
clinton,1,and we didnt put a single boot on the ground and gaddafi was deposed
clinton,1,the libyans turned out for one of the most successful fairest elections that any arab country has had
clinton,1,they elected moderate leaders
clinton,1,now there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability from north africa to afghanistan
clinton,1,and it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like libya
o'malley,0,john the world is a very dangerous place but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the united states of america provided we act according to our principles provided we act intelligently
o'malley,0,i mean lets talk about this arc of instability that secretary clinton talked about
o'malley,0,libya is now a mess
o'malley,0,syria is a mess
o'malley,0,iraq is a mess
o'malley,0,afghanistan is a mess
o'malley,0,as americans we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability
o'malley,0,and i wanted to add one other thing john and i think its important for all of us on this stage
o'malley,0,i was in burlington iowa
o'malley,0,and a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in iraq said governor o malley please when youre with your other candidates and colleagues on stage please dont use the term boots on the ground
o'malley,0,lets dont use the term boots on the ground
o'malley,0,my son is not a pair of boots on the ground
o'malley,0,these are american soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development diplomacy and our economic power in alignment with our principles
clinton,1,well i think its perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid
clinton,1,some of the bravest people that i had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone sometimes with our military into very dangerous places in iraq in afghanistan elsewhere
clinton,1,so there does need to be a whole of government approach but just because were involved and we have a strategy doesnt mean were going to be able to dictate the outcome
clinton,1,these are often very long  term kinds of investments that have to be made
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,sanders when you talk about the long term consequences of war lets talk about the men and women who came home from war
sanders,0,the 500000 who came home with ptsd and traumatic brain injury
sanders,0,and i would hope in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us and that we stand with them as they have stood with us
clinton,1,i dont think were at war with islam
clinton,1,i dont think were at war with all muslims
clinton,1,i think were at war with jihadists who have   
clinton,1,i think that you can talk about islamists who clearly are also jihadists but i think its not particularly helpful to make the case that senator sanders was just making that i agree with that weve got to reach out to muslim countries
clinton,1,weve got to have them be part of our coalition
clinton,1,if they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against islam that was one of the real contributions despite all the other problems that george w bush made after 9 11 when he basically said after going to a mosque in washington we are not at war with islam or muslims
clinton,1,we are at war with violent extremism
clinton,1,we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression
clinton,1,and yes we are at war with those people
clinton,1,but i dont want us to be painting with too broad a brush
clinton,1,i think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism its very hard to understand other than the lust for power the rejection of modernity the total disregard for human rights freedom or any other value that we know and respect
clinton,1,historically it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking what they will be doing how they will react
clinton,1,i plead that its very difficult when you deal with isis and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesnt seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and thats very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,sanders i dont think the term is whats important
sanders,0,what is important to understand is we have organizations whether it is isis or al qaida who do believe we should go back several thousand years
sanders,0,we should make women third class citizens that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted that they are a danger to modern society
sanders,0,and that this world with american leadership can and must come together to destroy them
sanders,0,we can do that
sanders,0,and it requires an entire world to come together including in a very active way the muslim nations
o'malley,0,i believe calling it what it is is to say radical jihadis
o'malley,0,thats calling it what it is
o'malley,0,but john lets not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our muslim american neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here
o'malley,0,they are our first line of defense
o'malley,0,and we are going to be able to defeat isis on the ground there as well as in this world because of the muslim americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion
o'malley,0,and now like never before we need our muslim american neighbors to stand up and to    and to be a part of this
clinton,1,yes
clinton,1,well we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists
clinton,1,we passed it after 9 11
clinton,1,it certainly does cover it
clinton,1,i would like to see it updated
clinton,1,no it would have to go through the congress and i know the white house has actually been working with members of congress
clinton,1,maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends come up with better intelligence
clinton,1,you know it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places but we have to keep trying
clinton,1,and we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to syria especially the ones with western passports that come back
clinton,1,so theres a lot of work we need to do and i want to be sure whats called the aumf has the authority that is needed going forward
sanders,0,sanders let me do that but let me pick up on an issue a very important issue that we have not yet discussed
sanders,0,this nation is the most powerful military in the world
sanders,0,were spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism
sanders,0,we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5000 nuclear weapons
sanders,0,i think we need major reform in the military making it more cost effective but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us
sanders,0,the cold war is over
sanders,0,and our focus has got to be on intelligence increased manpower fighting internationally targets
sanders,0,so in terms of refugees i believe that the united states has the moral responsibility with europe with gulf countries like saudi arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like afghanistan and syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that of course we reach out
sanders,0,now what the magic number is i dont know because we dont know the extent of the problem
sanders,0,but i certainly think that the united states should take its full responsibility in helping those people
o'malley,0,john i was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65000 syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of isil and i believe that that needs to be done with proper screening
o'malley,0,but accommodating 65000 refugees in our country today people of 320 million is akin to making room for 65 more people in a baseball stadium with 32000
o'malley,0,there are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike
o'malley,0,but i would want to agree with something that senator sanders says
o'malley,0,the nature of warfare has changed
o'malley,0,this is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of marines
o'malley,0,this is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as    serve our purposes as well as special ops better intelligence and being more proactive
o'malley,0,thats what i understand is the request from the international
o'malley,0,i would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids bodies washing up on a beach
clinton,1,i think that is the number one requirement
clinton,1,i also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees
clinton,1,the administration originally said 10
clinton,1,i said we should go to 65 but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine whatever resources it takes because i do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country
clinton,1,but i want to say a quick word about what senator sanders and then governor omalley said
clinton,1,we do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future not the past
clinton,1,but we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges
clinton,1,weve got challenges in the south china sea because of what china is doing in building up these military installations
clinton,1,we have problems with russia
clinton,1,just the other day russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon
clinton,1,so weve got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach
clinton,1,well first of all it isnt the middle class
clinton,1,i have made very clear that hardworking middle class families need a raise not a tax increase
clinton,1,in fact wages adjusted for inflation havent risen since the turn of the last century after my husbands administration
clinton,1,so we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again get incomes rising again
clinton,1,and i have laid out specific plans    you can go to my web site hillaryclintoncom and read the details
clinton,1,and i will pay for it by yes taxing the wealthy more closing corporate loopholes deductions and other kinds of favorable treatment
clinton,1,and i can do it without raising the debt without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time
clinton,1,well were going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business
clinton,1,for example it is outrageous that we dont have an opportunity for medicare to negotiate for lower prices
clinton,1,in fact american consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the national institute of health and that we then tested through the fda
clinton,1,so theres more to my plan than just the cap
clinton,1,we have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get medicare the authority to negotiate
o'malley,0,thats right
o'malley,0,nancy the blueprint in maryland that we followed was yes we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in america for five years in a row with that investment
o'malley,0,and yes we did ask everyone    the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuitions
o'malley,0,so while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do i actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a aaa bond rating but the highest median income in america
o'malley,0,i believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation investing in the skills of our people our infrastructure and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay    namely a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains
o'malley,0,i believe capital gains for the most part should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work sweat and toil
o'malley,0,and if we do those things we can be a country that actually can afford debt free college again
sanders,0,sanders let me put those proposals   and youre absolutely right
sanders,0,that is what i want to do
sanders,0,that is what is going to have to happen if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class
sanders,0,in the last 30 years there has been a massive redistribution of wealth
sanders,0,and i know that term gets my republican friends nervous
sanders,0,the problem is this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction
sanders,0,trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own
sanders,0,yes i do believe that we must end corporate loopholes such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax because theyre stashing the money in the cayman islands
sanders,0,yes i do believe there must be a tax on wall street speculation
sanders,0,we bailed out wall street
sanders,0,its their time to bail out the middle class help our kids be able to go to college tuition free
sanders,0,so we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations who have gotten away with murder for years start paying their fair share
sanders,0,sanders we havent come up with an exact number yet but it will not be as high as the number under dwight d eisenhower which was 90 percent
sanders,0,but it will belaughter
sanders,0,im not that much of a socialist compared to eisenhower
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,but    but we are going to end the absurdity as warren buffet often remind us
o'malley,0,thats right
sanders,0,sanders that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers
sanders,0,that makes no sense at all
sanders,0,there has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when im president
o'malley,0,and may i point out that under ronald reagans first term the highest marginal rate was 70 percent
o'malley,0,and in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy millionaire and billionaire category a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for americas middle class
clinton,1,well look i believe that weve made great progress as a country with the affordable care act
clinton,1,weve been struggling to get this done since harry truman
clinton,1,and it was not only a great accomplishment of the democratic party but of president obama
clinton,1,i do think that its important to defend it
clinton,1,the republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times
clinton,1,they would like to rip it up and start all over again throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that weve had about health care for quite some time now
clinton,1,i want to build on and improve the affordable care act
clinton,1,i would certainly tackle the cost issues because i think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women for example that yes we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market how to get the costs of    particularly prescription drugs but other out of pocket expenses down
clinton,1,but i think its important to understand theres a significant difference that i have with senator sanders about how best to provide quality affordable health care for everyone
clinton,1,and its   its a worthy debate
clinton,1,its an important one that we should be engaged in
sanders,0,sanders i am on the committee that helped write the affordable care act
sanders,0,we have made some good progress
sanders,0,now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the american people every single day
sanders,0,i am proud that i was the first member of congress to take americans over the canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one tenth the price they were paying in the united states
sanders,0,but at the end of the day no doubt the affordable care act is a step forward
sanders,0,i think we all support it
sanders,0,i believe weve got to go further
sanders,0,i want to end the international embarrassment of the united states of america being the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all people as a right not a privilege
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and also    also what we should be clear about is we end up spending    and i think the secretary knows this    far more per capita on health care than any other major country and our outcomes health care outcomes are not necessarily that good
o'malley,0,all right nancy i really wish youd come back to me on this on this one john
o'malley,0,because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs so whenever we come
o'malley,0,thank you
o'malley,0,well mr cooney weve actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform
o'malley,0,in fact if more border security and these    and more and more deportations were going to bring our republican brothers and sisters to the table it would have happened long ago
o'malley,0,the fact of the matter is    and lets say it in our debate because youll never hear this from that immigration bashing carnival barker donald trump the truth of the matter is applause
o'malley,0,the truth of the matter is net immigration from mexico last year was zero
o'malley,0,fact check me
o'malley,0,go ahead
o'malley,0,check it out
o'malley,0,but the truth of the matter is if we want wages to go up weve got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy and into the full light of an american economy
o'malley,0,thats what our parents and grandparents always did
o'malley,0,thats what we need to do as a nation
o'malley,0,yes we must protect our borders
o'malley,0,but there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people many of whom have known no other country but the united states of america
o'malley,0,our symbol is the statue of liberty
o'malley,0,it is not a barbed wire fence
clinton,1,well first of all i know that the president has appealed the decision to the supreme court
clinton,1,and my reading of the law and the constitution convinces me that the president has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents because i think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship
clinton,1,border security has always been a part of that debate
clinton,1,and it is a fact that the net immigration from mexico and south has basically zeroed out
clinton,1,so what we want to do is to say look we have 11 million people who have been here many of them for decades
clinton,1,they have children who are doing so well ive met and worked with dreamers
clinton,1,i think any parent would be so proud of them
clinton,1,so lets move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,sanders kathie let me say this
sanders,0,you know no public policy doesnt have in some cases negative consequences
sanders,0,but at the end of the day what you have right now are millions of americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low
sanders,0,real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years
sanders,0,so i believe that in fact this country needs to move towards a living wage
sanders,0,it is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week that person should not be living in poverty
sanders,0,it is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids
sanders,0,so i believe that over the next few years not tomorrow but over the next few years we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage 15 bucks an hour
sanders,0,and i apologize to nobody for that
sanders,0,sanders this is what i think    this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent one of the reasons that african american youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in america doesnt have any disposable income
sanders,0,you have no disposable income when you are make 10 12 bucks an hour
sanders,0,when we put money into the hands of working people theyre going to go out and buy goods theyre going to buy services and theyre going to create jobs in doing that
sanders,0,kathie that is the kind of economy i believe put money in the hands of working people raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour
o'malley,0,kathie this was not merely theory in maryland
o'malley,0,we actually did it
o'malley,0,not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage
o'malley,0,we were the first to pass a minimum wage
o'malley,0,and the us chamber of commerce which hardly ever says nice things about democratic governors anywhere named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship
o'malley,0,we defended the highest median income in the country
o'malley,0,and so look the way that    a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth
o'malley,0,and if our middle class makes more money they spend more money and our whole economy grows
o'malley,0,we did it and it worked and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it
o'malley,0,$1010 was all i could get the state to do by the time i left in my last year
o'malley,0,but two of our counties actually went to $1280 and their county executives if they were here tonight would also tell you that it works
o'malley,0,the fact of the matter is the more our people earn the more money they spend and the more our whole economy grows
o'malley,0,thats american capitalism
sanders,0,sanders let me just
clinton,1,kathie i think    kathie the
sanders,0,sanders let me just add to that
sanders,0,just because this is not an esoteric argument
sanders,0,youre seeing cities like seattle
sanders,0,youre seeing cities like san francisco cities like los angeles doing it and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income
clinton,1,but i do take what alan krueger said seriously
clinton,1,he is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage and what its effects are
clinton,1,and the overall message is that it doesnt result in job loss
clinton,1,however what alan krueger said in the piece youre referring to is that if we went to $15 there are no international comparisons
clinton,1,that is why i support a $12 national federal minimum wage
clinton,1,that is what the democrats in the senate have put forward as a proposal
clinton,1,but i do believe that is a minimum
clinton,1,and places like seattle like los angeles like new york city they can go higher
clinton,1,its what happened in governor omalleys state
clinton,1,there was a minimum wage at the state level and some places went higher
clinton,1,i think that is
o'malley,0,didnt just happen
clinton,1,i think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average weve ever had
o'malley,0,come on now
o'malley,0,yeah but look
o'malley,0,it should always be going up
o'malley,0,again with all do respect to secretary clinton
clinton,1,but you would index it    you would index it to the median wage
clinton,1,of course you would
clinton,1,do the $12 and you would index it
clinton,1,but i
o'malley,0,i think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on wall street
clinton,1,hes not wall street
o'malley,0, and start taking advice
clinton,1,thats not fair
clinton,1,hes a progressive economist
clinton,1,crosstalk
clinton,1,well i think its pretty clear that they know that i will
clinton,1,you have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super pac and theyre advertising against me in iowa as we speak
clinton,1,so they clearly think im going to do what i say i will do and you can look at what i did in the senate
clinton,1,i did introduce legislation to reign in compensation
clinton,1,i looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena
clinton,1,and specifically said to wall street that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down
clinton,1,ive laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in wall street    not just the big banks
clinton,1,thats a part of the problem and i am going right at them
clinton,1,i have a comprehensive tough plan
clinton,1,but i went further than that
clinton,1,we have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry
clinton,1,those hedge funds
clinton,1,look at what happened in 08 aig a big insurance company lehman brothers an investment bank helped to bring our economy down
clinton,1,so i want to look at the whole problem and thats why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else thats been put forth
sanders,0,sanders not good enough
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,heres the story
sanders,0,i mean you know lets not be naive about it
sanders,0,why do    why over her political career has wall street been a major    the major campaign contributor to hillary clinton
sanders,0,you know maybe theyre dumb and they dont know what theyre going to get but i dont think so
sanders,0,here is the major issue when we talk about wall street
sanders,0,it aint complicated
sanders,0,you have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent equivalent to 56 percent of the gdp in america
sanders,0,they issue two thirds of the credit cards and one third of the mortgages
sanders,0,if teddy roosevelt a good republican were alive today you know what hed say
sanders,0,break them up
sanders,0,reestablish glass steagall
sanders,0,and teddy roosevelt is right
sanders,0,that is the issue
sanders,0,now i am the only candidate up here that doesnt have a super pac
sanders,0,i am not asking wall street or the billionaires for money
sanders,0,i will break up these banks
sanders,0,support community banks and credit unions
sanders,0,thats the future of banking in america
sanders,0,sanders i have never heard a candidate never who has received huge amounts of money from oil from coal from wall street from the military industrial complex not one candidate say oh these campaign contributions will not influence me
sanders,0,im going to be independent
sanders,0,well why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions
sanders,0,they expect to get something
sanders,0,everybody knows that
sanders,0,once again i am running a campaign differently than any other candidate
sanders,0,we are relying on small campaign donors 750000 of them 30 bucks a piece
sanders,0,thats who im indebted to
clinton,1,well john wait a minute
clinton,1,wait a minute he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity
clinton,1,lets be frank here
sanders,0,sanders no i have not
clinton,1,oh wait a minute senator
clinton,1,you know not only do i have hundreds of thousands of donors most of them small
clinton,1,and im very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women 60 percent
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,so i represented new york and i represented new york on 9 11 when we were attacked
clinton,1,where were we attacked
clinton,1,we were attacked in downtown manhattan where wall street is
clinton,1,i did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild
clinton,1,that was good for new york
clinton,1,it was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country
clinton,1,so you know its fine for you to say what youre going to say but i looked very carefully at your proposal
clinton,1,reinstating glass  steagall is a part of what very well could help but it is nowhere near enough
clinton,1,my proposal is tougher more effective and more comprehensive because i go after all of wall street not just the big banks
o'malley,0,john please its   personal privilege john
o'malley,0,john john
sanders,0,sanders so was i john
sanders,0,let me get a chance to respond
sanders,0,this issue touches on two broad issues
sanders,0,its not just wall street
sanders,0,its campaign    a corrupt campaign finance system
sanders,0,and it is easy to talk the talk about ending citizens united but what i think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and wall street for campaign contributions and thats what im doing
sanders,0,in terms of wall street i respectfully disagree with you madam secretary in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth
sanders,0,when you have wall street spending $5 billion over a 10 year period to get    to get deregulated the only answer they know is break them up reestablish glass stegall
o'malley,0,well ill tell you what ive said this before
o'malley,0,i dont    i believe that we actually need some new economic thinking in the white house
o'malley,0,and i would not have robert rubin or larry summers with all due respect secretary clinton to you and to them back on my council of economic advisers
o'malley,0,they are the architects
o'malley,0,sure well have an inclusive group but i wont be taking my orders from wall street
o'malley,0,and look let me say this
o'malley,0,i put out a proposal
o'malley,0,i was on the front lines when people lost their homes when people lost their jobs
o'malley,0,i was on the front lines as a governor fighting against    fighting that battle
o'malley,0,our economy was wrecked by the big banks of wall street
o'malley,0,and secretary clinton when you put out your proposal on wall street it was greeted by many as quote unquote weak tea
o'malley,0,it is weak tea
o'malley,0,it is not what the people expect of our country
o'malley,0,we expect that our president will protect the main street economy from excesses on wall street
o'malley,0,and thats why bernies right
o'malley,0,we need to reinstate a modern version of glass steagall and we should have done it already
o'malley,0,applause
clinton,1,well you know governor i know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation you chose an investment banker in 2010
clinton,1,so for me it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in 08
clinton,1,and i will go back and say again aig was not a big bank
clinton,1,it had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us
clinton,1,lehman brothers was not a big bank
clinton,1,it was an investment bank
clinton,1,and its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us
clinton,1,so ive said if the big banks dont play by the rules i will break them up
sanders,0,sanders the big banks  
clinton,1,and i will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,sanders look  
sanders,0,sanders i dont know and with all due respect to the secretary wall street played by the rules
sanders,0,who are we kidding
sanders,0,the business model of wall street is fraud
sanders,0,thats what it is
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and we have    and let me make this promise
sanders,0,one of the problems we have had    i think all americans understand this is whether its republican administrations or democratic administrations we have seen wall street and goldman sachs dominate administrations
sanders,0,heres my promise   wall street representatives will not be in my cabinet
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i think that there are different records
clinton,1,i    you know know that senator sanders had a different vote than i did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers
clinton,1,that was a terrible mistake
clinton,1,it basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators not just in washington but across the country
clinton,1,but just think about this   since we last debated in las vegas nearly 3000 people have been killed by guns
clinton,1,twenty one mass shootings including one last weekend in des moins where three were murdered
clinton,1,two hundred children have been killed
clinton,1,this is an emergency
clinton,1,there are a lot of things weve got to do in our country reigning in wall street is certainly one of them
clinton,1,i agree with that
clinton,1,thats why ive got such a good plan
clinton,1,but we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of americans agree we should have universal background checks
clinton,1,close the gun show loophole close the online loophole and applause
clinton,1,i will do everything i can as president to get that accomplished
clinton,1,i    i said i made a mistake on iraq and i would love to see senator sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the senate that i see in the audience
clinton,1,lets reverse the immunity
clinton,1,lets put the gun makers and sellers on notice that theyre not going to get away with it
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,sanders lets do more    lets do more than reverse the immunity
sanders,0,lets
sanders,0,sanders let me hear if theres any difference between the secretary and myself
sanders,0,i have voted time and again to    for    for the background check and i want to see it improved and expanded
sanders,0,i want to see us do away with the gun show loophole
sanders,0,in 1988 i lost an election because i said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of america
sanders,0,we have to do away with the strawman proposal
sanders,0,we need radical changes in mental health in america so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need
sanders,0,we have    i dont know that theres any disagreement here
o'malley,0,oh yes there is
o'malley,0,laughter
sanders,0,sanders we have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work
sanders,0,sanders there were parts of that bill which agree with parts    i disagree
sanders,0,i am certainly absolutely willing to look at that bill again and make sure theres a stronger bill
o'malley,0,john this is another one of those examples
o'malley,0,like we have a    we have a lot of work to do and were the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do
o'malley,0,in my own state after the children in that connecticut classroom were gunned down we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks ban on assault weapons and senator i think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry
o'malley,0,but secretary clinton youve been on three sides of this
o'malley,0,when you ran in 2000 you said that we needed federal robust regulations
o'malley,0,then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as annie oakley and saying that we dont need those regulations on the federal level and now youre coming back around here
o'malley,0,so john theres a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle
o'malley,0,we got it done in my state by leading with principal and thats what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety
sanders,0,sanders with all    with all due respect applause
sanders,0,i think its fair to say that baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in america but the issue is
o'malley,0,but its a lot safer
o'malley,0,its saved a lot of lives along the way senator
sanders,0,sanders the issue is    i believe and i believe this honestly and i dont know that theres much difference on guns between us
sanders,0,but i believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control i believe that i am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the american people who agree with us on those issues
sanders,0,the problem is
sanders,0,sanders  people all over this country    not you secretary clinton    are shouting at each other
sanders,0,and what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and thats what i intend to do
sanders,0,crosstalk
o'malley,0,id like to take a matter of personal privilege here
clinton,1,but wait i just want to say this senator
clinton,1,there is broad consensus 92 percent in the most recently poll of americans want gun safety measures
sanders,0,sanders absolutely
clinton,1, and 85 percent of gun owners agree
sanders,0,sanders yes
clinton,1,weve got the consensus what were lacking is political leadership
sanders,0,sanders yes
clinton,1, and thats what you and others can start providing in the senate
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,sanders yes i agree
clinton,1,well im sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because i worked closely with new yorkers after 9 11 for my entire first term to rebuild
clinton,1,so yes i did know people
clinton,1,ive had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say i dont agree with you on everything but i like what you do
clinton,1,i like how you stand up
clinton,1,im going to support you and i think that is absolutely appropriate
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,sanders well i    if i might
sanders,0,i think the issue here is    and i applaud secretary clinton
sanders,0,she did
sanders,0,shes the senator from new york
sanders,0,she worked    and many of us supported you    in trying to rebuild that devastation
sanders,0,but at the end of the day wall street today has enormous economic and political power
sanders,0,their business model is greed and fraud
sanders,0,and for the sake of our economy they must    the major banks must be broken up
o'malley,0,john i think somewhere between
sanders,0,sanders well inaudible the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish glass steagall
sanders,0,i led the effort unfortunately unsuccessfully against deregulation because i knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good
sanders,0,the issue now is do we break them up do we reestablish glass steagall
sanders,0,and secretary clinton unfortunately is on the wrong side
clinton,1,well ill tell you who is on my side
clinton,1,paul krugman the nobel prize winning economist who said my plan for what we should do to reign in wall street was more comprehensive and better
clinton,1,paul volcker one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses has also said he does not support reinstating glass steagall
clinton,1,so i mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion
clinton,1,i have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating glass steagall
clinton,1,i just dont think it would get the job done
clinton,1,im all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do
clinton,1,applause
o'malley,0,john there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of wall street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets
o'malley,0,thats not capitalism secretary clinton
o'malley,0,thats crony capitalism
o'malley,0,thats a wonderful business model
o'malley,0,if you place bad bets the taxpayers bail you out
o'malley,0,but if you place good ones you pocket it
o'malley,0,look i dont believe theres the model    theres lots of good people that work in finance secretary sanders but secretary clinton we need to step up and we need to protect main street from wall street and you cant do that by    by campaigning as the candidate of wall street
o'malley,0,i am not the candidate of wall street
sanders,0,sanders let me
o'malley,0, and i encourage everybody watching this tonight to please acknowledge that by going online at martinomalleycom and help me wage this campaign for real american capitalism
o'malley,0,applause
sanders,0,sanders thank you
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,looking forward to it
sanders,0,sanders yes
sanders,0,sanders right
sanders,0,sanders and we are going to do a political revolution which brings working people young people senior citizens minorities together
sanders,0,because every issue that i am talking about   paid family and medical leave breaking up the banks on wall street asking the wealth to pay their fair share of taxes rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour    every one of those issues is supported by a significant majority of the american people
sanders,0,the problem is that as a result of a corrupt campaign finance system congress is not listening to the american people
sanders,0,its listening to the big money interest
sanders,0,what the political revolution is about is bringing people together to finally say enough is enough
sanders,0,this government belongs to us
sanders,0,not just the billionaires
sanders,0,sanders yes
sanders,0,sanders yes
sanders,0,sanders yeah
sanders,0,sanders what we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes american democracy and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class we can bring about the change that we need
sanders,0,if we are not successful if we continue the same old same old of washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big money interests nothing changes
sanders,0,what i am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people mostly young people
sanders,0,what the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people
sanders,0,were giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in america
sanders,0,thats what the political revolution is about
sanders,0,sanders no
sanders,0,thats just media stuff
sanders,0,i was sick and tired of hillary clintons e mail
sanders,0,i am still sick and tired of hillary clintons e mails
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,and the issue is the problem is the front pages every day were dealing with it
sanders,0,i didnt know i had so much power
sanders,0,but after i said that were not hearing so much about hillary clintons e mails
sanders,0,what i would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing why we have more people in jail than any other country why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality and were the only major country on earth without paid family and medical leave
sanders,0,weve gotten off the hillarys e mails good
sanders,0,lets go to the major issues facing america
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i agree completely
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i couldnt have said it better myself
clinton,1,but i did want to    i wanted to follow up
clinton,1,look we need more americans to be involved in the political process
clinton,1,and i give senator sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people    young old everybody    who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard
clinton,1,look at whats happening with the republicans
clinton,1,they are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of americans to be heard
clinton,1,applause theyre trying to prevent people from registering to vote
clinton,1,so we do need to take on the republicans very clearly and directly
clinton,1,but the other thing i just wanted quickly to say is i think president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in washington despite the republican obstructionists
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i think after 11 hours thats pretty clear yes
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and you know i do think its important to do exactly what senator sanders said and that is to start talking about the issues that the american people really care about and that they talk to each of us about
clinton,1,and to contrast even    there are differences among us
clinton,1,youve heard some of those tonight
clinton,1,i still want to get back to health care because i think thats a worthy topic to explore
clinton,1,but the differences among us pale compared to whats happening on the republican side
clinton,1,and if you listen to what they say    and i had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen as well as what i see in their debates    they are putting forth alarming plans
clinton,1,i mean all of us support funding planned parenthood
clinton,1,all of us believe climate change is real
clinton,1,all of us want equal pay for equal work
clinton,1,they dont believe in any of that
clinton,1,so lets focus on what this election is really going to be about
clinton,1,applause
o'malley,0,john i think the    i think the call of your question is how can we improve both public safety in america and race relations in america understanding how very intertwined both of those issues are in a very very difficult and painful way for us as a people
o'malley,0,look the truth of the matter is that we should all feel a sense of responsibility as americans to look for the things that actually work to save and redeem lives and to do more of them and to stop doing the things that dont
o'malley,0,for my part thats what i have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor
o'malley,0,we restored voting rights to 52000 people
o'malley,0,we decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana
o'malley,0,i repealed the death penalty
o'malley,0,and we also put in place a civilian review board
o'malley,0,we reported openly discourtesy and lethal force and brutality complaints
o'malley,0,this is something that    and i put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience
o'malley,0,so as president i would lead these efforts and i would do so with more experience and probably the attendance at more grave sites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban crime loss of lives
o'malley,0,and the truth is i have learned on a very daily basis that yes indeed black lives matter
sanders,0,sanders well this is what i would say and the congressman was right
sanders,0,according to the statistics that im familiar with a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system
sanders,0,fifty one percent of high school african american graduates are unemployed or underemployed
sanders,0,we have more people in jail today than any other country on earth
sanders,0,were spending $80 billion locking people up disproportionately latino and african american
sanders,0,we need very clearly major major reform in a broken criminal justice system
sanders,0,from top to bottom
sanders,0,and that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity    kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed they must be held accountable
sanders,0,it means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested
sanders,0,it means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana
clinton,1,well john i come from the 60s a long time ago
clinton,1,there was a lot of activism on campus    civil rights activism antiwar activism womens rights activism    and i do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out
clinton,1,obviously i believe that on a college campus there should be enough respect so people hear each other
clinton,1,but what happened at the university there whats happening at other universities i think reflects the deep sense of you know concern even despair that so many young people particularly of color have
clinton,1,you know i recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods and hearing their stories was so incredibly profoundly heartbreaking
clinton,1,each one of them you know described their child had a picture
clinton,1,you know the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and you know some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldnt turn the radio down
clinton,1,or a young woman who had been performing at president obamas second inauguration coming home absolutely stellar young woman hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member
clinton,1,and of course i met the mothers of eric garner and tamir rice and michael brown and trayvon martin and so many of them who have lost their children
clinton,1,so your original question is the right question
clinton,1,and its not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer
clinton,1,its really a question for all of us to answer every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god given potential
clinton,1,and thats what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country
sanders,0,sanders no it is not throwing    it is an extraordinary investment for this country
sanders,0,germany many other countries do it already
sanders,0,in fact if you remember 50 60 years ago the university of california city university of new york were virtually tuition free
sanders,0,here is the story    its not just the college graduates should be $50000 or $100000 in debt
sanders,0,more importantly i want kids in burlington vermont or baltimore maryland who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade who dont have a lot of money whose parents    like my parents    may never have gone to college
sanders,0,do you know where im going kevin
sanders,0,i want those kids to know that if they study hard they do their homework regardless of the income of their families they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free
sanders,0,this is revolutionary for education in america
sanders,0,it will give hope to millions of young people
sanders,0,sanders yes
sanders,0,sanders well i think that theyre be pretty smart because i think a lot of the states will do the right thing and i think those states that dont will pay a heavy penalty
sanders,0,bottom line here is in the year 2015 we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago
sanders,0,if you want to make it into the middle class    im not saying in all cases    we need plumbers and we need carpenters and electricians thats for sure and they should get help as well
sanders,0,but bottom line now is in america in the year 2015 any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education college education regardless of the income of his or her family
sanders,0,and we must substantially lower as my legislation does interest rates on student debt
o'malley,0,okay thank you
o'malley,0,i have    look i would agree with much of what senator sanders says kevin
o'malley,0,i believe that actually affordable college debt free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation
o'malley,0,and unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage i actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuition
o'malley,0,i respectfully disagree with senator sanders approach
o'malley,0,i believe that the goal should be debt free college
o'malley,0,i believe that our federal government needs to do more on pell grants
o'malley,0,states need to stop cutting higher education and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states skin in the game and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government
o'malley,0,7 percent and 8 percent to go to college
o'malley,0,i mean my dad went to college on a gi
o'malley,0,bill after coming home from japan flying 33 missions
o'malley,0,my daughters went to college on a mountain of bills
o'malley,0,we were proud of them on graduation day but were going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives
o'malley,0,it    it doesnt need to be that way
o'malley,0,we can have debt free college in the united states
clinton,1,kevin if i could just jump in
clinton,1,i    i believe that we should make community college free
clinton,1,we should have debt free college if you go to a public college or university
clinton,1,you should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition
clinton,1,i want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference whether a young person can stay in school or not
clinton,1,i disagree with free college for everybody
clinton,1,i dont think taxpayers should be paying to send donald trumps kids to college
clinton,1,i think it ought to be a compact    families contribute kids contribute
clinton,1,and together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future
sanders,0,sanders its not going to happen tomorrow
sanders,0,and its probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies
sanders,0,but at the end of the day nancy here is the question    in this great country of ours with so much intelligence and so much capability why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right
sanders,0,why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want
sanders,0,why is it that we are spending per capita far far more than canada which is 100 miles away from my door that guarantees health care to all people
sanders,0,it will not happen tomorrow
sanders,0,but when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies it will happen and i will lead that effort
sanders,0,medicare for all single payer system is the way we should go
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,revolution never came
clinton,1,i waited and i got the scars to show for it
clinton,1,we now have this great accomplishment known as the affordable care act and i dont think we should have to be defending it among democrats
clinton,1,we ought to be working to improve it and prevent republicans from both underming it and even repealing it
clinton,1,i have looked at    i have looked at the legislation that senator sanders has proposed and basically he does eliminate the affordable care act eliminates private insurance eliminates medicare eliminates medicaid tricare childrens health insurance program    puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer
clinton,1,and i have to tell you i would not want    if i lived in iowa terry branstad administering my health care
clinton,1,i    i think    i think as democrats we ought to proudly support the affordable care act improve it and make it the model that we know it can be
sanders,0,sanders well let me just say something
sanders,0,sanders we dont eliminate medicare
sanders,0,we expand medicare to all people
sanders,0,and we will not under this proposal have a situation that we have right now with the affordable care act where you have states like south carolina and many other republican states that because of their right wing political ideology are denying millions of people the expansion of medicaid that we passed in the affordable care act
sanders,0,ultimately we have got to say as a nation secretary clinton is health care a right of all people or is it not
sanders,0,i believe it is a right
o'malley,0,may i jump in here for 30 seconds on health care
clinton,1,well there are so many i dont know where to start
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1,i guess the one i    i would pick is the fact that i was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after bin laden
clinton,1,i spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us
clinton,1,but probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it
clinton,1,the intelligence was by no means absolute
clinton,1,we had all kinds of questions that we discussed and you know at the end i recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin laden and to finally bring him to justice
clinton,1,it was an excruciating experience
clinton,1,i couldnt talk to anybody about it
clinton,1,in fact after it happened the president called my husband    he called all the former presidents and he said to bill well i assume hillary has told you about this
clinton,1,and bill said no no she hasnt
clinton,1,there was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face
o'malley,0,john i dont think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say therefore i am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with
o'malley,0,but i can tell you this
o'malley,0,i can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor i learned certain disciplines which i believe are directly applicable to that very very powerful and most important of all jobs in the united states the president whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country
o'malley,0,you learn that threats always change
o'malley,0,you learn to create a security cabinet
o'malley,0,you learn to create feedback mechanisms
o'malley,0,you learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with
o'malley,0,i have been tried under many different emergencies and i can tell you that in each of those emergencies whether they were inflicted by drug gangs whether they were natural emergencies i knew how to lead and i knew how to govern because i know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life
sanders,0,sanders john i had the honor of being chairman of the us senate committee on veterans affairs for two years
sanders,0,and in that capacity i met with just an extraordinary group of people from world war ii from korea vietnam all of the wars
sanders,0,people came back from iraq and afghanistan without legs without arms
sanders,0,and i was determined to do everything that i could to make va health care the best in the world to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending
sanders,0,we brought together legislation supported by the american legion the vfw the dod vietnam vets all of the veterans organizations which was comprehensive
sanders,0,clearly the best piece of veterans legislation brought forth in decades
sanders,0,i could only get two republican votes on that
sanders,0,we ended up with 56 votes
sanders,0,we needed 60
sanders,0,so what i had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasnt the bill that i wanted
sanders,0,sit down with people like john mccain
sanders,0,sit down with people like jeff miller the republican chairman of the house and work on a bill
sanders,0,it wasnt the bill that i wanted but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans legislation passed in recent history
sanders,0,so the crisis was i lost what i wanted
sanders,0,but i had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could
o'malley,0,john thank you and to all of the people in iowa for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process
o'malley,0,if you believe that our countrys problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking new and fresh approaches then i ask you to join my campaign
o'malley,0,go on to martinomalleycom
o'malley,0,no hour is too short no dollar too small
o'malley,0,if you    we will not solve our nations problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past or by returning to polarizing figures from our past
o'malley,0,we are at the threshold of a new era of american progress but its going to require that we act as americans based on our principles here at home making an economy that works for all of us
o'malley,0,and also acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners
o'malley,0,there is no challenge too great for the united states to confront provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days
o'malley,0,i need your help
o'malley,0,thank you very very much
o'malley,0,applause
clinton,1,well thank you very much to cbs and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you
clinton,1,ive heard a lot about me in this debate and im going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately i think the presidents job is to do everything possible everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,starting with our children and moving forward
clinton,1,ive spent my entire life since i started as a young lawyer for the childrens defense fund trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in america this great country of ours who are behind who dont have a chance
clinton,1,and thats what i will do as your president
clinton,1,i will work my heart out
clinton,1,i need your help
clinton,1,all of you in iowa i need you to caucus for me
clinton,1,please go to hillaryclintoncom and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,sanders john    john this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on earth
sanders,0,we have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by super pacs
sanders,0,we are the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee healthcare to all people
sanders,0,we have the highest rate of childhood poverty and were the only country in the world    virtually the only country that doesnt guarantee paid family and medical leave
sanders,0,thats not the america that i think we should be
sanders,0,but in order to bring about the changes that we need we need a political revolution
sanders,0,millions of people are going to have to stand up turn off the tv get involved in the political process and tell the big  money interest that we are taking back our country
sanders,0,please go to berniesanderscom
sanders,0,please become part of the political revolution
sanders,0,thank you
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well thank you
clinton,1,and im delighted to be here in new hampshire for this debate
clinton,1,you know the american president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone not just those at the top
clinton,1,thats the job
clinton,1,i have a strategy to combat and defeat isis without getting us involved in another ground war and i have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night
clinton,1,im very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our republican counterparts
clinton,1,from my perspective we have to prevent the republicans from rolling back the progress that weve made
clinton,1,they would repeal the affordable care act not improve it
clinton,1,they would give more tax breaks to the super wealthy and corporations not to the middle class
clinton,1,and they would despite all their tough talk about terrorism continue to let people who are on the no fly list buy guns
clinton,1,so we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the democratic party what we will do for our country and i look forward to this evenings discussion of real issues that face the american people
clinton,1,thank you
o'malley,0,martha thank you
o'malley,0,tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far because tonight is different because of this reason that in the course of this presidential campaign america has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists american lives taken from us
o'malley,0,so yes we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward but the first job of the president of the united states is to protect the people of the united states
o'malley,0,i visited with a number of our neighbors in northern virginia at a mosque last friday
o'malley,0,and as i looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors i also looked in the eyes of veterans
o'malley,0,i looked into the eyes of boy scouts
o'malley,0,i looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our countrys values and our freedoms
o'malley,0,what our nation needs right now is to realize that while we face a terrible danger we also face a different sort of political danger
o'malley,0,and that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other
o'malley,0,what our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as americans
o'malley,0,we will rise to challenge of isil and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy
o'malley,0,but we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us which means we must never surrender them to terrorists must never surrender our americans values to racist must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths
o'malley,0,we are a better country than this
o'malley,0,our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence it is the statue of liberty
o'malley,0,and americas best days are in front of us if we move forward together
o'malley,0,applause
sanders,0,good evening
sanders,0,i am running for president of the united states because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics
sanders,0,im running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent
sanders,0,im running for president because im going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires
sanders,0,im running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families
sanders,0,im running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy
sanders,0,im running for president because i want a new foreign policy one that takes on isis one that destroys isis but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the middle east but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting muslim troops on the ground
sanders,0,thats the kind of coalition we need and thats the kind of coalition i will put together
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,david let me give you a little bit of background here
sanders,0,the dnc has hired vendors
sanders,0,on two occasions there were breeches in information two months ago
sanders,0,our staff found information on our computers from the clinton campaign
sanders,0,and when our staffers said whoa whats going here
sanders,0,they went to the dnc quietly
sanders,0,they went to the vendor and said hey something is wrong and that was quietly dealt with
sanders,0,none of that information was looked at
sanders,0,our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing
sanders,0,a few days ago a similar incident happened
sanders,0,there was a breach because the dnc vendor screwed up information came to our campaign
sanders,0,in this case our staff did the wrong thing    they looked at that information
sanders,0,as soon as we learned that they looked at that information   we fired that person
sanders,0,we are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved
sanders,0,thirdly what i have a really problem and as you mentioned   this is a problem i recognize it as a problem
sanders,0,but what the dnc did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign
sanders,0,that is an egregious act
sanders,0,im glad that late last night that was resolved
sanders,0,fourthly i work    look forward to working with secretary clinton for an investigation an independent investigation about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign because i am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign
sanders,0,dont know that
sanders,0,but we need an independent investigation and i hope secretary clinton will agree with me for the need of that
sanders,0,last point
sanders,0,when we saw the breach two months we didnt go running to the media and make a big deal about it
sanders,0,and it bothers me very much that rather than working on this issue to resolve it it has become many press releases from the clinton campaign later
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,yes i apologize
sanders,0,not only    not only do i apologize to secretary clinton    and i hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one    i want to apologize to my supporters
sanders,0,this is not the type of campaign that we run
sanders,0,and if i find anybody else involved in this they will also be fired
clinton,1,i very much appreciate that comment bernie
clinton,1,it really is important that we go forward on this
clinton,1,i know that you now have your data back and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen
clinton,1,obviously we were distressed when we learned of it because we have worked very hard    i said in the beginning of this campaign we want to reach as many voters as possible and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us
clinton,1,and so now that i think you know we have resolved your data we have agreed on an independent inquiry we should move on
clinton,1,because i dont think the american people are all that interested in this
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i think theyre more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us
o'malley,0,yeah david look for crying out loud our country has been attacked we have pressing issues involving how were going to adapt to this changing era of warfare
o'malley,0,our economy    people are working harder and being left behind
o'malley,0,you want to know why things dont get done in washington
o'malley,0,because for the last 24 hours with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight wondering how theyre even be able to buy presents for their kids
o'malley,0,instead were listening to the bickering back and forth
o'malley,0,maybe that is normal politics in washington but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party
o'malley,0,we need to address our security issues we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table
o'malley,0,and if people want a more high minded politics and want to move our country forward go on to martinomalleycom and help my campaign move our country forward
o'malley,0,applause
sanders,0,let me agree with governor omalley and let me agree with secretary clinton
sanders,0,you know we had this incident before secretary with your famous e mails
sanders,0,right
sanders,0,and what i said and i think what governor omalley is saying and i hope you say is when the middle class of this country is disappearing when we have massive income and wealth inequality when were the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people all the issues that the governor talked about the secretary talked about those are the issues
sanders,0,media notwithstanding
sanders,0,those are the issues that the american people want discussed
sanders,0,i hope those are the issues well discuss
clinton,1,well first the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of america safe
clinton,1,i have a plan that ive put forward to go after isis
clinton,1,not to contain them but to defeat them
clinton,1,and it has three parts
clinton,1,first to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both syria and iraq
clinton,1,secondly to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism
clinton,1,and thirdly to do more to keep us safe
clinton,1,under each of those three parts of my plan i have very specific recommendations about what to do
clinton,1,obviously in the first we do have to have a    an american led air campaign we have to have arab and kurdish troops on the ground
clinton,1,secondly weve got to go after everything from north africa to south asia and beyond
clinton,1,and then most importantly here at home i think there are three things that we have to get right
clinton,1,we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information
clinton,1,that now includes the internet because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence
clinton,1,that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies
clinton,1,they cant see the government as an adversary we cant see them as obstructionists
clinton,1,weve got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what theyre planning
clinton,1,and we must work more closely with muslim american communities
clinton,1,just like martin i met with a group of muslim americans this past week to hear from them about what theyre doing to try to stop radicalization
clinton,1,they will be our early warning signal
clinton,1,thats why we need to work with them not demonize them as the republicans have been doing
o'malley,0,david i am the very first
o'malley,0,i am the very first post 9 11 mayor and the very first post 9 11 governor
o'malley,0,i understand from the ground up that when attacks like san bernardino happen when attacks like the attacks of 9 11 happen that when people call 911 the first people to show up are the local first responders
o'malley,0,many of the things secretary clinton said are absolutely true but they underscore a lack of investment that we have as a nation failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering intelligence analysis intelligence sharing
o'malley,0,not only in theater in syria and iraq and other places where we embalk sic ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next but here in the homeland as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies
o'malley,0,i believe that whats happened here is that the president had us on the right course but its a lack of battle tempo
o'malley,0,we have to increase the battle tempo we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future
sanders,0,im one of the 77 percent
sanders,0,i think this is a very difficult issue
sanders,0,let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said
sanders,0,let me tell you what i think we have got to do
sanders,0,i think its a two pronged issue
sanders,0,number one our goal is to crush and destroy isis
sanders,0,what is the best way to do it
sanders,0,well i think there are some differences of opinion here perhaps between the secretary and myself
sanders,0,i voted against the war in iraq because i thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the middle east
sanders,0,i do not believe in unilateral american action
sanders,0,i believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces major powers and the muslim nations
sanders,0,i think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there in a dangerous and difficult world one of the heroes who we should recognize in the middle east is king abdullah ii of jordan
sanders,0,this small country has welcomed in many refugees
sanders,0,and abdullah said something recently very important
sanders,0,he said yes international terrorism is by definition an international issue but it is primarily an issue of the muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of islam
sanders,0,we the muslims should lead the effort on the ground
sanders,0,and i believe he is absolutely right
clinton,1,well i think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us
clinton,1,clearly we have to have a very specific set of actions to take
clinton,1,you know when senator sanders talks about a coalition i agree with him about that
clinton,1,weve got to build a coalition abroad
clinton,1,we also have to build a coalition at home
clinton,1,abroad we need a coalition that is going to take on isis
clinton,1,i know how hard that is
clinton,1,i know it isnt something you just hope people will do and ive worked on that
clinton,1,yes im getting
clinton,1,
clinton,1,im getting to that
clinton,1,because i think if you only think about the coalition abroad youre missing the main point which is we need a coalition here at home
clinton,1,guns in and of themselves in my opinion will not make americans safer
clinton,1,we lose 33000 people a year already to gun violence arming more people to do what i think is not the appropriate response to terrorism
clinton,1,i think what is applause
clinton,1,is creating much deeper closer relations and yes coalitions within our own country
clinton,1,the first line of defense against radicalization is in muslim american community
clinton,1,people who we should be welcoming and working with
clinton,1,i worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the republicans particularly donald trump is sending a message to muslims here in the united states and literally around the world that there is a clash of civilizations that there is some kind of western plot or even war against islam which then i believe fans the flames of radicalization
clinton,1,so guns have to be looked at as its own problem but we also have to figure out how were going to deal with the radicalization here in the united states
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,its a country in which people choose to buy guns
sanders,0,i think half of the    more than half of the people in my own state of vermont my guess here in new hampshire are gun owners
sanders,0,thats the right of people
sanders,0,but this is what i do believe
sanders,0,i believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country i believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings not only in san bernardino but in colorado and movie theaters in colorado i think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations
sanders,0,for example talking about polls a poll recently came out overwhelming majority of the american people say we should strengthen the instant background check
sanders,0,who denies that it is crazy applause
sanders,0,who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable
sanders,0,weve got to eliminate the gun show loophole
sanders,0,in my view we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians
sanders,0,i think there is a consensus
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i think    im not going to say that everybody is in agreement
sanders,0,its a divided country on guns
sanders,0,but there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that i coming from a state that has virtually no gun control will do my best to bring together
o'malley,0,martha if i may
o'malley,0,excuse me no
o'malley,0,i am the only person on this stage who has actually
o'malley,0, passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons david
o'malley,0,and look there are profound differences applause
o'malley,0,senator sanders voted against the brady bill
o'malley,0,senator sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers
o'malley,0,and senator sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue
o'malley,0,secretary clinton changes her position on this every election year it seems having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against president obama and saying we dont need federal standards
o'malley,0,look what we need on this issue is not more polls
o'malley,0,we need more principle
o'malley,0,when isil does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the united states of america is at a gun show then we should all be waking up
o'malley,0,we need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons
o'malley,0,because martha it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons
o'malley,0,you know we are the only nation only developed nation on the planet
o'malley,0,no martha i would not
o'malley,0,and thats not what we did in maryland
o'malley,0,but you know what we did in maryland
o'malley,0,we overcame the nras objections
o'malley,0,we overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there
o'malley,0,we did our own rallies
o'malley,0,and at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way we can address a major vulnerability in our country
o'malley,0,isil videos isil training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in america is at a gun show
o'malley,0,and its because of the flip flopping political approach of washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years
sanders,0,whoa whoa whoa
sanders,0,lets calm down a little bit martin
clinton,1,yes lets tell the truth martin
o'malley,0,i am telling the truth
sanders,0,first of all lets have some rules here commentators
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,he sure did
clinton,1,he invoked mine as well
sanders,0,sure did
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,first off we can do all the great speeches we want but youre not going to succeed unless there is a consensus
sanders,0,in 1988 just to set the record straight governor i ran for the us house
sanders,0,we have one house member from vermont three candidates in the race
sanders,0,one candidate said you know what i dont think its a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly
sanders,0,gun people said there were three candidates in the race you vote for one of the others but not bernie sanders
sanders,0,i lost that election by three percentage points
sanders,0,quite likely for that reason
sanders,0,so please do not explain to me coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control
sanders,0,crosstalk
sanders,0,excuse me
sanders,0,do not tell me that i have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people in voting to ban assault weapons voting for instant background checks voting to end the gun show loop hole and now were in a position to create a consensus in america on gun safety
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i do and this is an important issue and i know well get to a lot of other critical ones as well
clinton,1,i actually agree with governor omalley about the need for common sense gun safety measures
clinton,1,and i applaud his record in maryland
clinton,1,i just wish he wouldnt misrepresent mine
clinton,1,i have been for the brady bill i have been against assault weapons
clinton,1,i have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity
clinton,1,and i also know that    and im glad to see this    senator sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what were confronting in our country
clinton,1,i know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers to the sellers to the gun lobby
clinton,1,and i would hope senator sanders that you would join the democrats who are trying to close the charleston loophole that you would sponsor or co sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity
clinton,1,we need to move on this consensus that exists in the country
clinton,1,its no longer enough just to say the vast majority of americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners
clinton,1,we need and only the three of us will do this nobody on the republican side will even admit theres a problem
clinton,1,and in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well i think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what theyre seeing
clinton,1,first what they saw in paris now what they have seen in san bernardino
clinton,1,and mr trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions
clinton,1,so what i would say is number one we need to be united against the threats that we face
clinton,1,we need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if its suspicious reporting what you hear
clinton,1,making sure that muslim americans dont feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help
clinton,1,you know i was a senator from new york after 9 11 and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks
clinton,1,one of the best things that was done and george w bush did this and i give him credit was to reach out to muslim americans and say were in this together
clinton,1,you are not our adversary you are our partner
clinton,1,and we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that trump is sending around the world dont fall on receptive ears
clinton,1,he is becoming isiss best recruiter
clinton,1,they are going to people showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists
clinton,1,so i want to explain why this is not in americas interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry
sanders,0,well the answer is obviously if you see suspicious activity you report it
sanders,0,thats kind of a no brainer
sanders,0,you know somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house i think its a good idea to call 911
sanders,0,do it
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,but i want to talk    i want to talk about something else because secretary clinton i think made some interesting and good points
sanders,0,what you have now is a very dangerous moment in american history
sanders,0,the secretary is right our people are fearful
sanders,0,they are anxious on a number of levels
sanders,0,they are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on america
sanders,0,we all understand that
sanders,0,but you know what else theyre anxious about
sanders,0,theyre anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours theyre worried about their kids and theyre seeing all the new income and wealth    virtually all of it    going to the top 1 percent
sanders,0,and theyre looking around them and theyre looking at washington and theyre saying the rich are getting much richer im getting poorer what are you going to do about it
sanders,0,what are you going to do for my kids
sanders,0,and somebody like a trump comes along and says i know the answers
sanders,0,the answer is that all of the mexicans theyre criminals and rapists weve got to hate the mexicans
sanders,0,those are your enemies
sanders,0,we hate all the muslims because all of the muslims are terrorists
sanders,0,weve got to hate the muslims
sanders,0,meanwhile the rich get richer
sanders,0,so what i say to those people who go to donald trumps rallies understand he thinks a low minimum wage in america is a good idea
sanders,0,he thinks low wages are a good idea
sanders,0,i believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from
sanders,0,lets create an america that works for all of us not the handful on top
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,martha may i    martha may i crosstalk
o'malley,0,can i share this quick story
o'malley,0,oh
o'malley,0,all right
o'malley,0,when you come back to me ill share that story
clinton,1,i would not want to go to that point
clinton,1,i would hope that given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement that there could be a manhattan like project something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see theyre not adversaries theyve got to be partners
clinton,1,it doesnt do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after
clinton,1,there must be some way
clinton,1,i dont know enough about the technology martha to be able to say what it is but i have a lot of confidence in our tech experts
clinton,1,and maybe the back door is the wrong door and i understand what apple and others are saying about that
clinton,1,but i also understand when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks    to go back to our early questions how do we prevent attacks    well if we cant know what someone is planning we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or you know the member of the mosque or the teacher somebody to see something
clinton,1,i just think theres got to be a way and i would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out
clinton,1,otherwise law enforcement is blind    blind before blind during and unfortunately in many instances blind after
clinton,1,so we always have to balance liberty and security privacy and safety but i know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe
clinton,1,and thats what i hope there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve
o'malley,0,i believe that we should never give up our privacy never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security
o'malley,0,we need to figure this out together
o'malley,0,we need a collaborative approach
o'malley,0,we need new leadership
o'malley,0,the way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out
o'malley,0,the federal government should have to get warrants
o'malley,0,thats not some sort of passé you know antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms
o'malley,0,but at the same time with new technologies i believe that the people creating these projects    i mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out true to our american principles and values
o'malley,0,my friend kashif who is a doctor in maryland back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves
o'malley,0,he was putting his 10 and 12 year old boys to bed the other night
o'malley,0,and he is a proud american muslim
o'malley,0,and one of his little boys said to him dad what happens if donald trump wins and we have to move out of our homes
o'malley,0,these are very very real issues
o'malley,0,this is a clear and present danger in our politics within
o'malley,0,we need to speak to what unites us as a people freedom of worship freedom of religion freedom of expression
o'malley,0,and we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as donald trump
clinton,1,well i agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting
clinton,1,i dont think a halt is necessary
clinton,1,what we have to do is put all of our resources through the department of homeland security through the state department through our intelligence agencies and we have to have an increased vetting and screening
clinton,1,now this takes david 18 months to 24 months two years
clinton,1,so i know its not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done
clinton,1,but the process should move forward while we are also taking on isis putting together the kind of strategy that ive advocated for and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible
clinton,1,because i do believe that we have a history and a tradition that is part of our values system and we dont want to sacrifice our values
clinton,1,we dont want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve
clinton,1,so i want us to have a very tough screening process but i want that process to go forward
clinton,1,and if at the end of 18 months 24 months there are people who have been cleared and i would prioritize widows and orphans and the elderly people who may have relatives families or have nowhere else to go
clinton,1,i would prioritize them
clinton,1,and that would i think give the american public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees
o'malley,0,no what i would say is this is look i was the first of the three of us to call for america to accept the 65000 refugees we were asked to accept
o'malley,0,and if this humanitarian crisis increases we should accept more
o'malley,0,david there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees
o'malley,0,i met recently with some members of the chaldean christian communities and the wait times are a year 18 months 24 months
o'malley,0,there is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through
o'malley,0,we need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers
o'malley,0,what these chaldean families told me was that their families in syria when isis moves into their town they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition and that tells the family youd better get out now
o'malley,0,the sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering these are not the perpetrators
o'malley,0,we need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the statue of liberty and we need to act like the great country we are according to our values
sanders,0,excuse me
sanders,0,may i have a chance to respond to this issue
sanders,0,yeah but the rule includes equal    got it
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,lets keep going
sanders,0,ok
sanders,0,yeah
sanders,0,and i also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in iraq which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders    foreign policy blunders in the history of our country
sanders,0,i voted against the first gulf war which set the stage i believe for the second iraq war
sanders,0,and what i believe right now and i believe this is terribly important is the united states of america cannot succeed or be thought of as the policeman of the world that when theres an international crisis all over the world in france and in the uk or    hey just call up the american military and the american taxpayers theyre going to send the troops
sanders,0,and if they have to be in the middle east for 20 or 30 years no problem
sanders,0,i have a problem with that martha
sanders,0,what i believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition including russia a well coordinated effort
sanders,0,but i agree as i mentioned a moment ago with king abdullah
sanders,0,this is a war for the soul of islam
sanders,0,the troops on the ground should not be american troops
sanders,0,they should be muslim troops
sanders,0,i believe that countries like saudi arabia and qatar have got to step up to the plate have got to contribute the money that we need and the troops that we need to destroy isis with american support
sanders,0,my plan is to make it work to tell saudi arabia that instead of going to war in yemen they one of the wealthiest countries on earth are going to have to go to war against isis
sanders,0,to tell qatar that instead of spending $200 billion on the world cup maybe they should pay attention to isis which is at their doorstep
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,not at all
clinton,1,i think that what were facing with isis is especially complicated
clinton,1,it was a different situation in afghanistan
clinton,1,we were attacked from afghanistan
clinton,1,al qaida was based in afghanistan
clinton,1,we went after those who had attacked us
clinton,1,whats happening in syria and iraq is that because of the failures in the region including the failure of the prior government in baghdad led by maliki there has been a resurgence of sunni activities as exemplified by isis
clinton,1,and we have to support sunni arab and kurdish forces against isis because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in as opposed to special operators as opposed to trainers because that is exactly what isis wants
clinton,1,theyve advertised that
clinton,1,they want american troops back in the middle east
clinton,1,they want american soldiers on the ground fighting them giving them many more targets and giving them a great recruiting opportunity
clinton,1,so i think its absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining were going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis
clinton,1,and we do have to form a coalition
clinton,1,i know how hard that is
clinton,1,i have formed them
clinton,1,i put together a coalition including arabs with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran
clinton,1,and you have to really work hard at it
clinton,1,and the final thing i would say bringing donald trump back into it if youre going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of isis you dont want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition
clinton,1,and so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well i just think youre asking a question with a false choice
clinton,1,i believe if we lead an air coalition which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it if we continue to build back up the iraqi army which has had some recent success in ramadi as you know if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in anbar to try to rebuild those relationships which were very successful in going after al qaida in iraq if we get the turks to pay more attention to isis than theyre paying to the kurds if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that i am outlining i think we can be successful in destroying isis
clinton,1,so thats what im focused on thats what ive outlined and thats what i would do as president
o'malley,0,well we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground
o'malley,0,and what im talking about is not only the covert cia intelligence im also talking about diplomatic intelligence
o'malley,0,i mean weve seen time and time again especially in this very troubled region of nation state failures and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward
o'malley,0,so what i would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms but we do our military a disservice when we dont greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly the role of sustainable development in all of this
o'malley,0,as president i would make the administrator of usaid an actual cabinet member
o'malley,0,we have to act in a much more whole of government approach as general dempsey said
o'malley,0,and i do believe and i would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues this is a genocidal threat
o'malley,0,they have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders to be created to be created in the areas of syria and iraq
o'malley,0,we cannot allow safe havens and as a leader of moral nations around this earth we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats because martha this will not be the last region where nation states fail
o'malley,0,and youve seen a little bit of this emerging in the    in the african union and the things that they have done to better stabilize somalia
o'malley,0,we need to pay attention here in central america as well
o'malley,0,so this is the new type of threats that were facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions
clinton,1,well i just want to quickly add
clinton,1,martha that    you know one of the reasons why i have advocated for a no fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within syria to try to protect people on the ground both from assads forces who are continuing to drop barrel bombs and from isis
clinton,1,and of course it has to be de conflicted with the russians who are also flying in that space
clinton,1,im hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the security council which embodies actually an agreement that i negotiated back in geneva in june of 2012 were going to get a diplomatic effort in syria to begin to try to make a transition
clinton,1,a no fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces
clinton,1,i do not think it would come to that
clinton,1,we are already de conflicting air space
clinton,1,we know
clinton,1,no i dont think so
clinton,1,i am advocating
clinton,1,i am advocating the no fly zone both because i think it would help us on the ground to protect syrians im also advocating it because i think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with russia
clinton,1,now that russia has joined us in the security council has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in geneva three years ago now i think we can have those conversations
clinton,1,the no fly zone i would hope would be also shared by russia
clinton,1,if they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of assad toward isis and put the assad future on the political and diplomatic track where it belongs
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,i have a difference of opinion with secretary clinton on this
sanders,0,our differences are fairly deep on this issue
sanders,0,we disagreed on the war in iraq
sanders,0,we both listened to the information from bush and cheney
sanders,0,i voted against the war
sanders,0,but i think    and i say this with due respect    that i worry too much that secretary clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be
sanders,0,yes we could get rid of saddam hussein but that destabilized the entire region
sanders,0,yes we could get rid of gadhafi a terrible dictator but that created a vacuum for isis
sanders,0,yes we could get rid of assad tomorrow but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit isis
sanders,0,so i think yeah regime change is easy getting rid of dictators is easy
sanders,0,but before you do that youve got to think about what happens the day after
sanders,0,and in my view what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that were not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists that in fact we are going to move steadily    and maybe slowly    toward democratic societies in terms of assad a terrible dictator
sanders,0,but i think in syria the primary focus now must be on destroying isis and working over the years to get rid of assad
sanders,0,thats the secondary issue
clinton,1,that is exactly
clinton,1,that is exactly what i just said and what i just described
clinton,1,and that is important because now we have a un security council that will enable us to do that
clinton,1,and you know with all due respect senator you voted for regime change with respect to libya
clinton,1,you joined the senate in voting to get rid of gadhafi and you asked that there be a security council validation of that with a resolution
clinton,1,all of these are very difficult issues
clinton,1,i know that ive been dealing with them for a long time
clinton,1,and of course we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like gadhafi a despot with american blood on his hands is overturned
clinton,1,but ill tell you what would have happened if we had not joined with our european partners and our arab partners to assist the people in libya you would be looking at syria
clinton,1,now the libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge isis from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation
sanders,0,i was not the secretary of state
clinton,1,i think were missing the point here
clinton,1,we are doing both at the same time
clinton,1,well i dont agree with that because we will not get the support on the ground in syria to dislodge isis if the fighters there who are not associated with isis but whose principal goal is getting rid of assad dont believe there is a political diplomatic channel that is ongoing
clinton,1,we now have that
clinton,1,we have the un security council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path
clinton,1,its very important we operate on both at the same time
clinton,1,and let me just say a word about coalition building because ive heard senator sanders say this
clinton,1,i know how hard it is to build coalitions
clinton,1,i think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more iranian troops inside syria
clinton,1,that is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire
clinton,1,the iranians getting more of a presence in syria linking with hezbollah their proxy in lebanon would threaten israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with assads future
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,i happen to think
o'malley,0,id like to offer a applause
sanders,0,secretary clinton is right
sanders,0,this is a complicated issue
sanders,0,i dont think anyone has a magical solution
sanders,0,but this is what i do believe
sanders,0,yes of course assad is a terrible dictator
sanders,0,but i think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right
sanders,0,the immediate    it is not assad who is attacking the united states
sanders,0,it is isis
sanders,0,and isis is attacking france and attacking russian airliners
sanders,0,the major priority right now in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of isis
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i think    and i think we bring together that broad coalition including russia to help us destroy isis
sanders,0,and work on a timetable to get rid of assad hopefully through democratic elections
sanders,0,first priority destroy isis
o'malley,0,may i offer a different generations perspective on this
o'malley,0,during the cold war    during the cold war we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists and who was wearing the us jersey
o'malley,0,we got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies old methodologies to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the united states
o'malley,0,look what we did in iran with mossadegh
o'malley,0,and look at the results that were still dealing with because of that
o'malley,0,i would suggest to you that we need to leave the cold war behind us and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this and we need to restrain ourselves
o'malley,0,i mean i know secretary clinton was gleeful when gadhafi was torn apart
o'malley,0,and the world no doubt is a better place without him
o'malley,0,but look we didnt know what was happening next
o'malley,0,and we fell into the same trap with assad saying    as if its our job to say assad must go
o'malley,0,we have a role to play in this world
o'malley,0,but we need to leave the cold war and that sort of antiquated thinking behind
o'malley,0,i believe that we need to focus on destroying isil
o'malley,0,that is the clear and present danger
o'malley,0,and i believe that we can springboard off of this new un resolution and we should create as secretary clinton indicated and i agree with that that there should be a political process
o'malley,0,but we shouldnt be the ones declaring that assad must go
o'malley,0,where did it ever say in the constitution where is it written that its the job of the united states of america or its secretary of state to determine when dictators have to go
o'malley,0,we have a role to play in this world
o'malley,0,but it is not the world    the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy
o'malley,0,crosstalk
sanders,0,david
clinton,1,since he has been making all kinds of comments
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1,i think its fair to say assad has killed by last count about 250000 syrians
clinton,1,the reason we are in the mess were in that isis has the territory it has is because of assad
clinton,1,i advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when i was still secretary of state because i worried we would end up exactly where we are now
clinton,1,and so when we look at these complex problems i wish it could be either or
clinton,1,i wish we could say yes lets go destroy isis and lets let assad continue to destroy syria which creates more terrorists more extremists by the minute
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,we now finally are where we need to be
clinton,1,we have a strategy and a commitment to go after isis which is a danger to us as well as the region sanders 
clinton,1, secretary
clinton,1,and we finally have a un security council resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in syria
sanders,0,could i just say    just say this
clinton,1,if the united states does not lead there is not another leader
clinton,1,there is a vacuum
sanders,0,can i just say this
clinton,1,and we have to lead if were going to be successful
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,of course the united states must lead
sanders,0,but the united states is not the policeman of the world
sanders,0,the united states must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the middle east
sanders,0,the united states at the same time cannot successfully fight assad and isis
sanders,0,isis now is the major priority
sanders,0,lets get rid of assad later
sanders,0,lets have a democratic syria
sanders,0,but the first task is to bring countries together to destroy isis
clinton,1,sorry
sanders,0,first of all we recognize that we have a rigged economy as youve indicated
sanders,0,middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing are we better off today than we were when bush left office
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,but as youve indicated for millions of american workers people in new hampshire    all over america theyre working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids
sanders,0,so what do we do
sanders,0,first statement is we tell the billionaire class they cannot have it all
sanders,0,for a start theyre going to start to pay their fair share of taxes
sanders,0,second of all what we do is you raise the minimum wage to living wage 15 bucks an hour over the next several years
sanders,0,next thing we do pay equity for women workers
sanders,0,women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that
sanders,0,next thing that we do real unemployment    official unemployment 5 percent real employment 10 percent youth unemployment off the charts
sanders,0,we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our roads our bridges our rail systems we create 13 million jobs with a trillion dollar investment
sanders,0,furthermore in a competitive global economy it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world
sanders,0,that is why im going to have a tax on wall street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in america are tuition free
o'malley,0,look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession
o'malley,0,we actually passed a living wage
o'malley,0,we raised the minimum wage
o'malley,0,we actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market american capitalism work is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state
o'malley,0,all through the recession we defended the highest median income in america and the second highest median income for african american families
o'malley,0,how
o'malley,0,by actually doing more for education
o'malley,0,we increased education funding by 37 percent
o'malley,0,we were the only state in american that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition
o'malley,0,we invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future
o'malley,0,we created 2000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices
o'malley,0,so david the conclusion of all of those things is this they werent hopes they werent dreams they werent amorphous goals out there
o'malley,0,we actually took action to do these things and as president i have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all american families
o'malley,0,universal national service is an option for every kid in america to cut youth employment
o'malley,0,and im the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for americas cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great american cities and get them back to work
clinton,1,well ive been talking to a lot of these families and this is such an outrage both because its bad for our economy were a 70 percent consumption economy people need to feel optimistic and confident they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded and its bad for our democracy
clinton,1,its absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged that has consequences
clinton,1,i think its great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues because youre not going to hear anything like this from any of the republicans who are running for president
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,they dont want to raise the minimum wage they dont want to do anything to increase incomes
clinton,1,at the center of my economic policy is raising incomes because people havent been able to get ahead and the cost of everything from college tuition to prescription drugs has gone up
clinton,1,of course we have to raise the minimum wage
clinton,1,of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing like we see with market basket right here in new hampshire and new england where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and weve got to do more on equal pay for equal work
clinton,1,that means pass the paycheck fairness act so we have transparency about how much people are making
clinton,1,thats the way to get womens wages up and thats good for them and good for their families and good for our communities
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and there is a lot we can do in college affordability
clinton,1,i have debt free tuition plans free community college plans getting student debt down
clinton,1,i also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down
clinton,1,and theres a lot
clinton,1,you can go to my website
clinton,1, hillaryclintoncom and read about it
clinton,1,but i guess the final thing that    that i would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the republicans in the fall
clinton,1,this is the election
clinton,1, issues they have to respond to
clinton,1,everybody should
clinton,1,laughter and applause
clinton,1,look i have said i want to be the president for the struggling the striving and the successful
clinton,1,i want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share which they have not been doing
clinton,1,i want the buffett rule to be in effect where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases
clinton,1,i want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy
clinton,1,but i also want to create jobs and i want to be a partner with the private sector
clinton,1,im particularly keen on creating jobs in small business
clinton,1,my dad was a small businessman a really small business
clinton,1,i want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses
clinton,1,so if    if people who are in the private sector know what i stand for its what i fought for as a senator its what i will do as president and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody more power to them because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we dont get the american economy moving and growing were not going to recognize our country and were not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had
sanders,0,no i think they wont
sanders,0,laughter and applause
sanders,0,so hillary and i have a difference
sanders,0,the ceos of large multinationals may like hillary
sanders,0,they aint going to like me and wall street is going to like me even less
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and the reason for that is weve got to deal with the elephant in the room which is the greed recklessness and illegal behavior on wall street
sanders,0,when you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two thirds of the credit cards and one third of the mortgages when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail weve got to re  establish glass steagall we have got to break the large financial institutions up
sanders,0,so i dont think applause
sanders,0, having said that i dont think im going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from wall street
sanders,0,i dont have a super pac
sanders,0,i dont want campaign contributions from corporate america
sanders,0,and let me be clear while there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing in my view    and i say this very seriously    the greed of the billionaire class the greed of wall street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of americans
sanders,0,we need an economy that works for the middle class not just a handful of billionaires and i will fight and lead to make that happen
o'malley,0,look i look at our economy as an ecosystem
o'malley,0,and the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate the more our workers earn the more they will spend the more our economy will grow
o'malley,0,and most heads of businesses    large medium and small    understand that
o'malley,0,but there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage
o'malley,0,were not going to fix what ails our economy were not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace american capitalism with socialism    which by the way the rest of the world is moving away from    nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of wall street directed crony capitalism
o'malley,0,and for my part i have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on wall street in ways that secretary clinton never ever has
o'malley,0,in fact in the last debate very shamefully she tried to hide her cozy relationship with wall street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9 11
o'malley,0,i believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition
o'malley,0,theres mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and its bad for    for upward mobility of wages
o'malley,0,and the worst type of concentration secretary clinton is the concentration of the big banks the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them oh you werent responsible for the crash not by a long shot
o'malley,0,and thats why today you still cannot support as i do breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern day glass  steagall like we had in late 1999 before it was repealed and led to the crash where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes
o'malley,0,and i was on the front lines of that looking into the eyes of my neighbors
clinton,1,ok
clinton,1,let me respond
clinton,1,under the rules i have been    i have been invoked david so let me respond very quickly
clinton,1,number one
clinton,1,number one there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in new hampshire
clinton,1,they started in iowa
clinton,1,now youd have to ask yourself why are they running ads against me
clinton,1,and the answer is because they know i will go right after them that i will not let their agenda be americas agenda
clinton,1,secondly i think its important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world
clinton,1,you can go to opensecretsorg and check that
clinton,1,i have more donations from students and teachers than i do from people associated with wall street
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,now number three    and let me say this    when governor omalley was heading the democratic governors association he had no trouble at all going to wall street to raise money to run campaigns for democratic governors
clinton,1,and he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor
clinton,1,so you know again the difference between us and the republicans is night and day
clinton,1,and there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the sec and the commodities future trading commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives which actually contributed to the collapse of lehman brothers and that was senator sanders
clinton,1,so if were going to be talking like this we can    and maybe we can score some political points    but the fact is every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every american
clinton,1,and if that means taking on wall street i have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both senator sanders and governor omalley are proposing
sanders,0,let me just    let me just
sanders,0,let me just jump in
sanders,0,my name was invoked
sanders,0,so with that invocation let me say a few words
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,secretary clinton i dont have a super pac
sanders,0,i dont get any money from wall street
sanders,0,you have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from wall street
sanders,0,but most importantly when you look at what happened in the 1990s go to berniesanderscom
sanders,0,ill advertise my web site as well
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,and what youll find is that i led    helped lead the effort as a member of the house financial committee against alan greenspan against a guy named bill clinton maybe you know him maybe you dont
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,against the republican leadership who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies
sanders,0,what a brilliant idea that would be
sanders,0,go to youtube
sanders,0,find out what i said to greenspan
sanders,0,at the end of the day if teddy roosevelt were alive today and the governor makes a good point about trade anti trade anti monopoly activities
sanders,0,wall street today has too much political power
sanders,0,it has too much economic power
sanders,0,to get deregulated    listen to this they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10 year period
sanders,0,wall street is a threat to the economy
sanders,0,theyve got to be broken up
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i would certainly build on the successes of the affordable care act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced
clinton,1,number one we do have more people who have access to health care
clinton,1,we have ended the terrible situation that people with pre  existing conditions were faced with where they couldnt find at any affordable price health care
clinton,1,women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance
clinton,1,and we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,those are all really positive developments
clinton,1,but out of pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof
clinton,1,and so what i have proposed number one is a $5000 tax credit to help people who have very large out of pocket costs be able to afford those
clinton,1,number two i want medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries health systems
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,we end up paying the highest prices in the world
clinton,1,and i want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the affordable care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed
clinton,1,and i think thats an important point to make because im going through and analyzing the points you were making martha
clinton,1,we dont have enough competition and we dont have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now
clinton,1,crosstalk
clinton,1,yes
clinton,1,well theyre glitches because
clinton,1,it is
clinton,1,because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing
clinton,1,we have fought as democrats for decades to get a health care plan
clinton,1,i know
clinton,1,ive got the scars to show from the effort back in the early 90s
clinton,1,we want to build on it and fix it
clinton,1,and im confident we can do that
clinton,1,and it will have effects in the private market
clinton,1,and one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend medicaid
clinton,1,and so people are still going to get health care thankfully in emergency rooms in hospitals
clinton,1,those costs are then added to the overall cost which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,yes exactly exactly
sanders,0,yes well roughly
sanders,0,let me say this
sanders,0,as a member of the health education committee that helped write the affordable care act much of what secretary clinton said about what we have done among other things ending the obscenity of this pre existing situation is a step forward
sanders,0,seventeen more million more people have health care
sanders,0,it is a step forward
sanders,0,a step forward
sanders,0,but this is what we also have to say
sanders,0,not only are deductibles rising 29 million americans still have no health insurance and millions of people cant afford to go to the doctor
sanders,0,major crisis and primary health care
sanders,0,here is the bottom line
sanders,0,why is it that the united states of america today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right
sanders,0,why is it applause
sanders,0,why is it that we are    why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the uk 50 percent more than what they pay in france countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases have better health care outcomes
sanders,0,bottom line
sanders,0,this ties into campaign finance reform
sanders,0,the insurance companies the drug companies are bribing the united states congress
sanders,0,we need to pass a medicare for all single payer system
sanders,0,it will lower the cost of health care for a middle class family by thousands of dollars a year
sanders,0,but they will not be paying martha any private insurance
sanders,0,so its unfair to say in total
sanders,0,i can tell you that adding up the fact youre not paying any private insurance businesses are not paying any private insurance
sanders,0,the average middle class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year
sanders,0,and universities
sanders,0,well neil i think weve got to work on a two pronged approach
sanders,0,and your point is absolutely well taken
sanders,0,the cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation
sanders,0,there are a lot of factors involved in that
sanders,0,and that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums
sanders,0,maybe we should focus on quality education with well paid faculty members
sanders,0,but applause
sanders,0,and i understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary
sanders,0,but bottom line is this is the year 2015
sanders,0,if we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce
sanders,0,it is insane to my mind hundreds of thousands of young people today bright qualified people cannot go to college because they cannot afford    their families cannot afford to send them
sanders,0,millions coming out of school as you indicated deeply in debt
sanders,0,what do we do
sanders,0,my proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street raise very substantial sums of money not only make public colleges and universities tuition free but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt
sanders,0,you have families out there paying 6 percent 8 percent 10 percent on student debt refinance their homes at 3 percent
sanders,0,what sense is that
sanders,0,so i think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education
sanders,0,we should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago
sanders,0,all young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,yes this one falls under the category of i have actually done this
o'malley,0,as a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuition
o'malley,0,my plan actually goes further than senator sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees
o'malley,0,so as a nation we need to increase what we invest in pell grants
o'malley,0,yes we need to make it easier for parents to refinance
o'malley,0,but states need to do more as well
o'malley,0,and i propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well
o'malley,0,i believe that all of our kids should go into an income based repayment plan
o'malley,0,im joined tonight by two daughters tara and grace
o'malley,0,my oldest daughters a teacher
o'malley,0,um and their mothers here as well
o'malley,0,we were proud of them on graduation day werent we katie
o'malley,0,and were going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives
o'malley,0,i mean we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones
o'malley,0,therere families all across america who arent able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan
o'malley,0,i also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after world war ii on a gi
o'malley,0,bill
o'malley,0,but today were the only nation on the planet thats saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills
o'malley,0,thats a drag on the economy
o'malley,0,its one of the key investments we need to make
o'malley,0,i was flattered that secretary clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers
o'malley,0,and in our party unlike the republican party we actually believe that the more our people learn the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid
clinton,1,right
clinton,1,well i have what i call the new college compact
clinton,1,because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game you know
clinton,1,number one states have been dis investing in higher education
clinton,1,in fact i think new hampshire in state tuition for public colleges and universities is among the highest if not the highest in the country
clinton,1,so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere into prisons into highways into things other than higher education
clinton,1,so under my compact the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system
clinton,1,secondly i dont believe in free tuition for everybody
clinton,1,i believe we should focus on middle class families working families and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead
clinton,1,so i have proposed debt free tuition which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense
clinton,1,so i put all of this together again on my website and ive gotten such a good response
clinton,1,but i want to quickly say one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems
clinton,1,free college a single payer system for health  and its been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion about a 40 percent in the federal budget
clinton,1,and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care to the states to have the states run
clinton,1,and i think weve got to be really thoughtful about how were going to afford what we proposed which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how im going to pay for it including college
sanders,0,may i respond to the critique on the 
sanders,0,i would just
sanders,0,but secretary clinton is wrong
sanders,0,as you know because i know you know a lot about health care
sanders,0,you know that the united states per capita pays far and away more than other country
sanders,0,and it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the secretarys clinton proposal
clinton,1,well the only thing   the only thing i can go on senator sanders
clinton,1,your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state
clinton,1,and my analysis is that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families
clinton,1,im the only person
clinton,1, saying no middle class tax raises
clinton,1,thats off the table
sanders,0,now this is getting to be fun
clinton,1,that is a pledge that im making
clinton,1,i made it when i ran in 2008
clinton,1,yes and it was the same one that president obama made
clinton,1,because i dont think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families taxes
clinton,1,we just heard that most families havent had a wage increase since 2001
clinton,1,since you know the end of the last clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody
clinton,1,and weve got to get back to where people can save money again where they can invest in their families and i dont think a middle class tax should be part of anybodys plan right now
sanders,0,let me respond to applause
sanders,0,let me respond to
sanders,0,number one most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own
sanders,0,now when secretary clinton says im not going raise taxes on the middle class let me tell you what she is saying
sanders,0,she is disagreeing with fdr on social security lbj on medicare and with the vast majority of progressive democrats in the house and the senate who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the united states being the only major country on earth that doesnt provide paid family and medical leave
sanders,0,what the legislation is is $161 a week
sanders,0,now you can say thats a tax on the middle class
sanders,0,it will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country
sanders,0,i think secretary clinton $161 a week is a pretty good investment
clinton,1,senator i have been    i have been fighting for paid
clinton,1, family leave for a very long time
sanders,0,david thank you
clinton,1,i have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it
sanders,0,then inaudible
clinton,1, not everybody else
sanders,0,every inaudible democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend kirsten gillibrand rosa delauro that is the legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave
o'malley,0,no ive never made a promise like that
o'malley,0,but unlike either of these two fine people ive actually balanced a budget every single year
o'malley,0,i was one    i was the only    one of only seven states that had a aaa bond rating
o'malley,0,by the time i left the average tax burden on maryland families was the same as when i started
o'malley,0,but i did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest earning people to pay another 14 percent
o'malley,0,david look this is the big    i agree by the way that we should have paid family leave
o'malley,0,and i agree with senator sanders on that
o'malley,0,and just like social security and unlike the republicans i think we should actually expand social security and increase average monthly benefits
o'malley,0,but look theres one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us those earning more than a million dollars feel that theyre entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains
o'malley,0,if we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college debt free college cutting youth unemployment in half investing in our cities again
o'malley,0,so the things i have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up
o'malley,0,thats the issue that we need to tackle as americans and we can do it and we know how
clinton,1,well david i think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country
clinton,1,we have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended
clinton,1,i feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect
clinton,1,trust has been totally lost in a lot of places
clinton,1,at the same time we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and theyre acting heroically
clinton,1,the young officer who was killed responding to the planned parenthood murders
clinton,1,the officer who told the victims of the san bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them
clinton,1,so i think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that president obama impaneled
clinton,1,we need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this
clinton,1,and we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system but more opportunities more jobs better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust
o'malley,0,there is no issue in american public policy that i have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing of law enforcement criminal justice and race in america
o'malley,0,when i ran in 1999 david for mayor of baltimore our city by that year had become the most addicted violent and abandoned in america
o'malley,0,but we came together
o'malley,0,i brought people together over some very deep racial divides
o'malley,0,and we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in america over the next ten years
o'malley,0,as governor we continued to work together
o'malley,0,we reduced violent crime to 30 year lows
o'malley,0,but get this
o'malley,0,we also reduced incarceration rates to 20 year lows
o'malley,0,so it is possible actually to find the things that actually work that we did increasing drug treatment using big data to better protect the lives of young people cut juvenile crime in half and its also possible to improve how we police our police
o'malley,0,but there wasnt a single day as mayor of baltimore that i wasnt asked whether i was delivering on the promise i made to police the police
o'malley,0,we reported excessive force discourtesy use of lethal force
o'malley,0,in fact drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force
o'malley,0,as a nation we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open more transparent and more accountable
o'malley,0,just as we require every major department every county to report its major crimes we should require police departments to report their discourtesy brutality excessive force
o'malley,0,theres so much work that can be done so much weve learned to do better
o'malley,0,we need to do it now as a nation
o'malley,0,this is our time and our opportunity to do that
sanders,0,well this whole issue concerns me
sanders,0,and i agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said
sanders,0,but lets be clear
sanders,0,today in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth 22 million people
sanders,0,predominantly african american and hispanic
sanders,0,we are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow americans
sanders,0,i think and this is not easy but i think we need to make wage a major effort to come together as a country and end institutional racism
sanders,0,we need major major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system
sanders,0,now what does that mean
sanders,0,well for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people predominantly african americans
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,it means that we have to rethink the so called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people which is why i have taken marijuana out of the controlled substance act
sanders,0,so that it will not be a federal crime
sanders,0,that is why we need to make applause
sanders,0,that is why we need to make police    and i speak as a former mayor
sanders,0,i was a mayor for eight years worked very closely with a great police department
sanders,0,and what we did is try to move that department toward community policing so that the police officers become part of the community and not as we see in some cities an oppressive force
sanders,0,we need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity
sanders,0,we need to end minimal sentencing
sanders,0,we need basically to pledge that were going to invest in this country in jobs and education not more jails and incarceration
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,yes
sanders,0,look this is a tragedy for new hampshire
sanders,0,it is a tragedy for my state of vermont
sanders,0,it is a tragedy all over this country
sanders,0,the number of heroin deaths are growing very very significantly
sanders,0,what do we do
sanders,0,well for a start this may seem like a radical idea but i think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country where young people are taking them getting hooked and then going to heroin
sanders,0,second of all and the reason i believe in a health care for all program we need to understand that addiction is a disease not a criminal activity
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and that means    and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues
sanders,0,when somebody is addicted and seeking help they should not have to wait three four months in order to get that help
sanders,0,they should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them
sanders,0,so those are some of the areas that i think weve got to move on
clinton,1,you know on my very first visit to new hampshire in this campaign i was in keene and i was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic
clinton,1,and all over new hampshire i met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose
clinton,1,i met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go because there are not enough facilities
clinton,1,so this is a major epidemic and it has hit new hampshire and vermont particularly hard
clinton,1,ive had had two town halls one in keene one in laconia dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do
clinton,1,and ive heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior how the recovery community is reaching out
clinton,1,and i was proud to get the endorsement of mayor walsh of boston who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena
clinton,1,so ive laid out a five point plan about what we can do together
clinton,1,i would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states and i really applaud governor hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan
clinton,1,we need to do more on the prescribing end of it
clinton,1,there are too many opioids being prescribed and that leads directly now to heroin addiction
clinton,1,and we need to change the way we do law enforcement and of course we need more programs and facilities so when somebody is ready to get help theres a place for them to go
clinton,1,and every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose naloxone so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring
o'malley,0,and you know i actually know a great deal about this issue
o'malley,0,and i have a dear friend played music with him for years remember when his    when he came home with his baby girl and now shes no longer with us because of addiction and overdose
o'malley,0,the last time in new hampshire i had to take a break shortly after landing and call home and comfort a friend whose mother had died of an overdose
o'malley,0,drugs have taken far too many of our citizens
o'malley,0,its a huge public health challenge
o'malley,0,in our own city i mentioned before we had become the most addicted city in america
o'malley,0,but together every single year i expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then i expanded it in our state and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work intervening earlier understanding the continuum of care thats required until we got hit like every other state in the state    in the united states especially in new hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction the over prescribing
o'malley,0,i agree we need better    we need to rein in the over  prescribing but i have put forward on my    in my plan a $12 billion federal investment
o'malley,0,we have to invest in the local partnerships and the best place to intervene the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction is at the hospital
o'malley,0,that very first time they show up with a near miss we should be intervening there
o'malley,0,thats what i said to my own public health people
o'malley,0,what would we do if this were ebola
o'malley,0,how would we act
o'malley,0,so many more americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills and yet we refuse to act
o'malley,0,there are thing that can be done
o'malley,0,go on to my website
o'malley,0,my plan is there
o'malley,0,its one of 15 strategic goals ive set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years
clinton,1,well first lets remember why we became part of a coalition to stop gadhafi from committing massacres against his people
clinton,1,the united states was asked to support the europeans and the arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not and eventually yes i recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of gadhafi
clinton,1,i think that what libya then did by having a full free election which elected moderates was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path
clinton,1,now the whole region has been rendered unstable in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do
clinton,1,but what were seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge isis from sirte the home town of gadhafi and to begin to try to create a national government
clinton,1,you know this is not easy work
clinton,1,we did a lot to help
clinton,1,we did as much as we could because the libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept
clinton,1,but were always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful
clinton,1,martha we offered a lot more than they were willing to take
clinton,1,we offered a lot more
clinton,1,we also got rid of their chemical weapons which was a big help and we also went after a lot of the shoulder fired missiles to round them up
clinton,1,you know we cant    if were not going to send american troops which there was never any idea of doing that then to try to send trainers to try to send experts is something we offered europeans offered the un offered and there wasnt a lot of responsiveness at first
clinton,1,i think a lot of the libyans who had been forced out of their country by gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the you know militaristic forces inside that country
clinton,1,but im not giving up on libya and i dont think anybody should
clinton,1,weve been at this a couple of years
clinton,1,well theres always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made
clinton,1,but i know that we offered a lot of help and i know it was difficult for the libyans to accept help
clinton,1,what we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done
sanders,0,but what
sanders,0,look the secretary is right
sanders,0,this is a terribly complicated issue
sanders,0,there are no simple solutions
sanders,0,but where we have a disagreement is that i think if you look at the history of regime changes you go back to mossadegh in iran you go back to salvador allende who we overthrew in chile you go back to overthrowing saddam hussein in iraq you go back to where we are today in syria with a dictator named assad
sanders,0,the truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like america to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator
sanders,0,so i think secretary clinton and i have a fundamental disagreement
sanders,0,im not quite the fan of regime change that i believe she is
o'malley,0,martha    i would just repeat that   
clinton,1,well i would just repeat that
clinton,1,wait a minute
clinton,1,i think its only fair to put on the record senator sanders voted in the senate for a resolution calling for ending the gadhafi regime and asking that the un be brought in either a congressional vote or a un security council vote
clinton,1,we got a un security council vote
clinton,1,now i understand that this is very difficult
clinton,1,and im not standing here today and saying that libya is as far along as tunisia
clinton,1,we saw what happened in egypt
clinton,1,i cautioned about a quick overthrow of mubarak and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship
clinton,1,this is a part of the world where the united states has tried to play two different approaches
clinton,1,one work with the tough men the dictators for our own benefit and promote democracy
clinton,1,thats a hard road to walk
clinton,1,but i think its the right road for us to try to travel
o'malley,0,and martha
o'malley,0, and in this case we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region
o'malley,0,and i believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence
o'malley,0,we have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up
o'malley,0,thats what chris stevens was trying to do
o'malley,0,but without the tools without the support that was needed to that
o'malley,0,and now what we have is a whole stretch now of the coast of libya 100 miles 150 miles that has now become potentially the next safe haven for isil
o'malley,0,they go back and forth between syria and this region
o'malley,0,we have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop
clinton,1,well the role has been defined by each person whos held it
clinton,1,and i am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern
clinton,1,obviously mrs obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young peoples health particularly nutrition and exercise
clinton,1,and i think has had a big impact
clinton,1,so whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution
clinton,1,and with respect to my own husband i am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that
clinton,1,but i will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions for advice and in particular how were going to get the economy working again for everybody which he knows a little bit about
sanders,0,given the fact that shes a lot smarter than me yes she would
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,and let me by the way take this moment to congratulate hillary clinton who i thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady but redefined what that role could be
sanders,0,so i thank you very much for that
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,my wife jane has been    way back when before i knew her a foster parent
sanders,0,many many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed
sanders,0,and she turned around many lives
sanders,0,she is the best parent and grandmother that i know
sanders,0,she has devoted her life when i was mayor of the city of burlington actually when i first met her we started a youth office which started a after school programs for kids started a child care center started a youth newspaper
sanders,0,we got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues
sanders,0,she led that effort
sanders,0,so i think at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners potentially getting into trouble i think we need a forceful advocate for the children for teenagers for the little children to deal with the dysfunctional child care system and i think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals
o'malley,0,well that would be totally up to her
o'malley,0,i mean katie has never been a person who let her husbands professional choices get in the way of following her dreams
o'malley,0,and i think she got that from her mother actually
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,the    and i readily admit that she is a far more accomplished lawyer than i was ever able to become before i took my detour
o'malley,0,she is a district court judge in maryland
o'malley,0,she puts in a full day there
o'malley,0,weve raised four terrific kids
o'malley,0,and yet when she was first lady of the state not only would she go to work every day and sit there through a lot of sad and gut wrenching cases but then shed put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence
o'malley,0,maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy and her understanding of how the court process works
o'malley,0,she was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti bullying things
o'malley,0,so katie omalley will do whatever katie omalley wants to do regardless of her husbands success in getting elected president
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,thank you
sanders,0,well thank you very much for hosting this debate and let me applaud my colleagues up here
sanders,0,because i think frankly maybe im wrong but on our worst day i think we have a lot more to offer the american people than the right wings extremists
sanders,0,applause my father came to this country from poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because i know what its like to be the son of an immigrant
sanders,0,we grew up in a three and a half room rent controlled apartment in brooklyn new york
sanders,0,my mothers dream    and she died very young but my mothers dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent controlled apartment and own a home of her own
sanders,0,she never lived to see that
sanders,0,but what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college
sanders,0,we were the first in the family
sanders,0,so i know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income
sanders,0,and that is why i am pledged if elected president of the united states to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough this great country and our government belong to all of us not just a handful of billionaires
sanders,0,thank you very much
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,martha thank you
o'malley,0,i want to thank all of the people who have tuned in tonight
o'malley,0,i want to thank the great people of new hampshire where despite all of the cynicism about big money and big banks taking over our politics here in new hampshire the individual matters
o'malley,0,you know my wife katie and i have four terrific kids and like you theres probably nothing we wouldnt do to give them a future thats safer thats healthier where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us
o'malley,0,tonight what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how wed do that that which we have always proven the capacity to do better than any nation in the world to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic social and political life of our country
o'malley,0,when you listened to the republican debate the other night you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear
o'malley,0,well they can have their anger and they can have their fear but anger and fear never built america
o'malley,0,we build our country by adopting wage and labor policies including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all
o'malley,0,we do it by investing in our country by investing in infrastructure by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt free college and we can do it again
o'malley,0,and we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times whether its terror trying to undermine our values or republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat
o'malley,0,the other big challenge we have is climate change
o'malley,0,the greatest business opportunity to come to the united states of america in 100 years
o'malley,0,we need to embrace this
o'malley,0,i have put forward a plan that does this that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050
o'malley,0,join this campaign for the future
o'malley,0,new leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times
o'malley,0,thank you
clinton,1,on january 20th 2017 the next president of the united states will walk into the white house
clinton,1,if heaven forbid that next president is a republican i think its pretty clear we know what will happen
clinton,1,a lot of the rights that have been won over years from womens rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights will be at risk
clinton,1,social security which republicans call a ponzi scheme may face privatization
clinton,1,our vets may see the va
clinton,1,hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization
clinton,1,planned parenthood will be defunded
clinton,1,the list goes on because the differences are so stark
clinton,1,you know everybody says every elections important and theres truth to that
clinton,1,this is a watershed election
clinton,1,i know how important it is that we have a democrat succeed president obama in the white house
clinton,1,and i will do all that i can in this campaign to reach out and explain what i stand for and what i will do as president
clinton,1,you know i became a grandmother 15 months ago and so i spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughters future
clinton,1,but as president i will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because i want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her god given potential
clinton,1,if you will join me in this campaign we will make that a mission
clinton,1,thank you good night and may the force be with you
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well good evening
clinton,1,and i want to thank the congressional black caucus institute and the people of charleston for hosting us here on the eve of martin luther king day tomorrow
clinton,1,you know i remember well when my youth minister took me to hear dr king
clinton,1,i was a teenager
clinton,1,and his moral clarity the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service
clinton,1,i also remember that he spent the last day of his life in memphis fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people
clinton,1,and that is our fight still
clinton,1,we have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone including those who have been left out and left behind
clinton,1,we have to keep our communities and our country safe
clinton,1,we need a president who can do all aspects of the job
clinton,1,i understand that this is the hardest job in the world
clinton,1,im prepared and ready to take it on and i hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the democratic party and the next president of the united states
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,thank you
sanders,0,as we honor the extraordinary life of dr martin luther king jr its important not only that we remember what he stood for but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country
sanders,0,as we look out at our country today what the american people understand is we have an economy thats rigged that ordinary americans are working longer hours for lower wages 47 million people living in poverty and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent
sanders,0,and then to make a bad situation worse we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections
sanders,0,this campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president but to transform this country
o'malley,0,thank you
o'malley,0,my name is martin omalley i was born the year dr king delivered his i have a dream speech
o'malley,0,and i want to thank the people of south carolina not only for hosting our debate here tonight but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at mother emanuel church
o'malley,0,you taught us in fact in keeping with dr kings teaching that love would have the final word when you took down the confederate flag from your state house let go of the past and move forward
o'malley,0,eight years ago you brought forward a new leader in barack obama to save our country from the second great depression
o'malley,0,and thats what hes done
o'malley,0,our countrys doing better were creating jobs again
o'malley,0,but in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law and we have urgent work to do and the voices of anger and fear and division that weve heard coming off of the republican presidential podiums are pretty loud
o'malley,0,we need new leadership
o'malley,0,we need to come together as a people and build on the good things that president obama has done
o'malley,0,thats why im running for president
o'malley,0,i need your help i ask for your vote and i look forward to moving our country forward once again
o'malley,0,thank you
sanders,0,well thats what our campaign is about
sanders,0,it is thinking big
sanders,0,it is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world we should have health care for every man woman and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour that we have got to create millions of decent  paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure
sanders,0,so what my first days are about is bringing america together to end the decline of the middle class to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us and not just big campaign contributors
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i would work quickly to present to the congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing infrastructure clean and renewable energy raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing finally equal pay for womens work
clinton,1,i would alsoapplausei would also be presenting my plans to build on the affordable care act and to improve it by decreasing the out of pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesnt take too much money out of the pockets of hard working americans
clinton,1,and third i would be working in every way that i knew to bring our country together
clinton,1,we do have too much division too much mean  spiritedness
clinton,1,theres a lot we have to do on immigration reform on voting rights on campaign finance reform but we need to do it together
clinton,1,thats how well have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve
clinton,1,applause
o'malley,0,thank you
o'malley,0,first of all i would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all americans rather than down
o'malley,0,equal pay for equal work making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour however we can wherever we can
o'malley,0,secondly i believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the united states of america in 100 years is climate change
o'malley,0,and i put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,finally — im sorry that was second lester
o'malley,0,and third and finally we need a new agenda for americas cities
o'malley,0,we have not had a new agenda for americas cities since jimmy carter
o'malley,0,we need a new agenda for america cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people that will invest in cbvg transportation infrastructure and transit options and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people
sanders,0,well i think secretary clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous
sanders,0,i have a d minus voting record from the nra
sanders,0,i was in 1988 there were three candidates running for congress in the state of vermont i stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons
sanders,0,i have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns
sanders,0,and that includes people of criminal backgrounds people who are mentally unstable
sanders,0,i support what president obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and i think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant
sanders,0,we have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people
sanders,0,this should not be a political issue
sanders,0,what we should be doing is working together
sanders,0,and by the way as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control i believe that i am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible
sanders,0,what i have said is that gun manufacturers liability bill has some good provisions among other things weve prohibited ammunition that wouldve killed cops who had protection on
sanders,0,we have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation
sanders,0,and what we also said is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun
sanders,0,so what i said is  i would re look at it
sanders,0,we are going to re  look at it and i will support stronger provisions
clinton,1,yes look i have made it clear based on senator sanders own record that he has voted with the nra with the gun lobby numerous times
clinton,1,he voted against the brady bill five times
clinton,1,he voted for what we call the charleston loophole
clinton,1,he voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the nra said was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years 
clinton,1,he voted to let guns go onto the amtrak guns go into national parks
clinton,1,he voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives
clinton,1,lets not forget what this is about 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country
clinton,1,thats 33000 people a year
clinton,1,one of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered
clinton,1,now i am pleased to hear that senator sanders has reversed his position on immunity and i look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation
clinton,1,there is no other industry in america that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed
o'malley,0,this is what i would say lester look see ive listened to secretary clinton and senator sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and i would have to agree with both of them
o'malley,0,theyve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue
o'malley,0,im the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation
o'malley,0,this is very personal to me being from baltimore
o'malley,0,i will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in johns hopkins hospital he was getting a birthday haircut the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boys head was pierced with a bullet
o'malley,0,and i remember visiting him it did not kill him   i remember visiting him and his mother in johns hopkins hospital
o'malley,0,he was getting a birthday haircut the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boys head was pierced with a bullet
o'malley,0,and i remember visiting him it did not kill him
o'malley,0,i remember visiting him and his mother in johns hopkins hospital
o'malley,0,in his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head same age as my little boy
o'malley,0,so after the slaughter of the kids in connecticut last year we brought people together
o'malley,0,we did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation
o'malley,0,it did have a ban on combat assault weapons universal background checks and you know what
o'malley,0,we did not interrupt a single persons hunting season
o'malley,0,ive never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an ar 15 to down a deer
o'malley,0,and soapplausewere able to actually do these things
clinton,1,well sadly its reality and it has been heartbreaking and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like walter scott as you said who have been killed by police officers
clinton,1,their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system
clinton,1,and that requires a very clear agenda for retraining police officers looking at ways to end racial profiling finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief
clinton,1,one out of three african american men may well end up going to prison
clinton,1,thats the statistic
clinton,1,i want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men and very often the black men are arrested convicted and incarcerated applausefor offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men
clinton,1,so we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore
sanders,0,well i — look
sanders,0, let me respond to what the secretary said
sanders,0,we have a criminal justice system which is broken
sanders,0,who in america is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth including china
sanders,0,disproportionately african american and latino
sanders,0,who is satisfied that 51% of african american young people are either unemployed or underemployed
sanders,0,who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the ceos of wall street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0, we need to take a very hard look at our
sanders,0, criminal justice system investing in jobs and education not in jails and incarceration 
sanders,0,well let me talk about polling
sanders,0,laughter as secretary clinton well knows when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me
sanders,0,we were all of three percentage points
sanders,0,guess what
sanders,0,in iowa new hampshire the race is very very close
sanders,0,maybe were ahead new hampshire
sanders,0,cheering
sanders,0,in terms of polling guess what
sanders,0,we are running ahead of secretary clinton
sanders,0,in terms of taking on my taking on my good friend donald trump beating him by 19 points in new hampshire 13 points in the last national poll that we saw
sanders,0,to answer your question
sanders,0,when the african american community becomes familiar with my congressional record and with our agenda and with our views on the economy and criminal justice — just as the general population has become more supportive so will the african american community so will the latino community
sanders,0,we have the momentum were on a path to a victory
sanders,0,applause and cheering
o'malley,0,lester i inaudible
o'malley,0,yes lets talk about this
o'malley,0,when i ran for mayor in 1999 lester it was not because our city was doing well
o'malley,0,it was because we were burying over 300 young poor black men every single year
o'malley,0,and thats why i ran because yes black lives matter
o'malley,0,and we did a number of things
o'malley,0,we werent able to make our city immune from setbacks as the freddie gray unrest and tragic death showed
o'malley,0,but we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations
o'malley,0,the truth of the matter is we created a civilian review board
o'malley,0,and many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that ive put forward
o'malley,0,we created a civilian review board gave them their own detectives
o'malley,0,we required the reporting of discourtesy use of excessive force lethal force
o'malley,0,i repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state
o'malley,0,i drove our incarceration rate down to 20 year lows and drove violent crime down to 30 year lows and became the first governor south of the mason dixon line to repeal the death penalty
o'malley,0,i feel a responsibility every day to find things that work applause
o'malley,0, and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system
sanders,0,i apologize for not hearing all of that question
sanders,0,yes
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,this is a responsibility for the us justice department to get involved
sanders,0,whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody it should automatically trigger a us attorney generals investigation
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,second of all and i speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers the vast majority of whom are honest hard  working people trying to do a difficult job but let us be clear
sanders,0,if a police officer breaks the law like any public official that officer must be held accountable
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and thirdly we have got to de militarize our police departments so they dont look like occupying armies
sanders,0,weve got to move toward community policing
sanders,0,and fourthly we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well lester youre right
clinton,1,everywhere i go to campaign im meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned
clinton,1,and ive met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren
clinton,1,so i have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that number one does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money about a billion dollars a year to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic
clinton,1,the policing needs to change
clinton,1,police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose known as narcan
clinton,1,they should be able to administer it
clinton,1,so should firefighters and others
clinton,1,we have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead move it to where it belongs as a health issue
clinton,1,and we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts into treatment and recovery
clinton,1,so this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now
clinton,1, a growing epidemic
sanders,0,sure
sanders,0,i agree applause
sanders,0,i agree with everything the secretary said but let me just add this there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it
sanders,0,and second of all when we talk about addiction being a disease the secretary is right what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment
sanders,0,people should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it not two months from now which is why i believe in universal
sanders,0, healthcare with mental health
sanders,0, a part of that
o'malley,0,lester just ten seconds
o'malley,0,just 10 seconds
o'malley,0,all of the things
clinton,1,well andrea i am absolutely committed to universal health care
clinton,1,i have worked on this for a long time people may remember that i took on the health insurance industry back in the 90s and i didnt quit until we got the childrens health insurance program that ensures eight million kids
clinton,1,and i certainly respect senator sanders intentions but when youre talking about health care the details really matter
clinton,1,and therefore we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years as to how they would work and what would be the impact on peoples health care
clinton,1,he didnt like that his campaign didnt like it either
clinton,1,and tonight hes come out with a new health care plan
clinton,1,and again we need to get into the details
clinton,1,but heres what i believe the democratic party and the united states worked since harry truman to get the affordable care act passed
clinton,1,we finally have a path to universal health care
clinton,1,we have accomplished so much already
clinton,1,i do not to want see the republicans repeal it and i dont to want see us start over again with a contentious debate
clinton,1,i want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,ok
sanders,0,secretary — secretary clinton didnt answer your question
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,because what her campaign was saying — bernie sanders who has fought for universal health care for my entire life he wants to end medicare end medicaid end the childrens health insurance program
sanders,0,that is nonsense
sanders,0,what a medicare for all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man woman and child as a right
sanders,0,now the truth is that frank delano roosevelt harry truman do you know what they believed in
sanders,0,they believed that health care should be available to all of our people
sanders,0,im on the committee that wrote the affordable care act
sanders,0,i made the affordable care act along with jim clyburn a better piece of legislation
sanders,0,i voted for it but right now what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance
sanders,0,we are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs getting ripped off
sanders,0,and heres the important point we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country
sanders,0,my proposal provide health care to all people get private insurance out of health insurance lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5000 bucks
sanders,0,thats the vision we need to take
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,but — senator sanders if i can applause
clinton,1,you know i have to say im not sure whether were talking about the plan you just introduced tonight or were talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the congress
clinton,1,but the fact is we have the affordable care act
clinton,1,that is one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama of the democratic party and of our country
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and we have already seen 19 million americans get insurance
clinton,1,we have seen the end of pre existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,we have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men
clinton,1,and we have seen young people up to the age of 26 being able to stay on their parents policy
sanders,0,but — what if we have
clinton,1,now there are things we can do to improve it but to tear it up and start over again pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate i think is the wrong direction
sanders,0,it is — it is absolutely inaccurate
o'malley,0,i have to talk about something thats actually working in our state
sanders,0,no one is tearing this up were going to go forward
sanders,0,but with the secretary neglected to mention not just the 29 million still have no health insurance that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles
sanders,0,tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the british who guarantee health care to all of their people
sanders,0,fifty percent more than the french more than the canadians
sanders,0,the vision from fdr and harry truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost effective way
sanders,0,were not going to tear up the affordable care act
sanders,0,i helped write it
sanders,0,but we are going to move on top of that to a medicaid for all system
o'malley,0,andrea — andrea — andrea
o'malley,0,crosstalk applause
o'malley,0,instead of — andrea i think instead of attacking one another on health care we should be talking about the things that are actually working
o'malley,0,in our state we have moved to an all payer system
o'malley,0,with the affordable care act we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals that driver of cost at the center away from fee for  service
o'malley,0,and actually to pay we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital
o'malley,0,how well they keep their patients
o'malley,0,thats the future
o'malley,0,we need to build on the affordable care act do the things that work and reduce costs and increase access
o'malley,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,and thats exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the affordable care act — what governor omalley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system
clinton,1,but with all due respect to start over again with a whole new debate is something that i think would set us back
clinton,1,the republicans just voted last week to repeal the affordable care act and thank goodness president obama vetoed it and saved obamacare for the american people
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,yeah
sanders,0,yes
sanders,0,not all that detailed
sanders,0,well
sanders,0,well thats — you might want to ask
sanders,0,andrea let me just say this
sanders,0,let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of vermont why he could not do it
sanders,0,im not the governor
sanders,0,im the senator from the state of vermont
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,but second of all — second of allapplause here is what the real point is in terms of all of the issues youve raised — the good questions youve raised
sanders,0,you know what it all comes down to
sanders,0,do you know why we cant do what every other country — major country on earth is doing
sanders,0,its because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt we have super pacs we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying and the private insurance companies as well
sanders,0,what this is really about is not the rational way to go forward — its medicare for all — it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money and the pharmaceutical industry
sanders,0,thats what this debate should be about
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well as someone who — as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry that spent you knowapplausemany many millions of dollars attacking me and probably will so again because of what i believe we can do building on the affordable care act i think its important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today
clinton,1,i know how much money influences the political decision making
clinton,1,thats why im for huge campaign finance reform
clinton,1,however we started a system that had private health insurance
clinton,1,and even during the affordable care act debate there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option
clinton,1,in other words people could buy in to medicare and even when the democrats were in charge of the congress we couldnt get the votes for that
clinton,1,so what im saying is really simple
clinton,1,this has been the fight of the democratic party for decades
clinton,1,we have the affordable care act
clinton,1,lets make it work
clinton,1,lets take the models that states are doing
clinton,1,we now have driven costs down to the lowest theyve been in 50 years
clinton,1,now weve got to get individual costs down
clinton,1,thats what im planning to do
o'malley,0,great question
clinton,1,well i think its an important point the president made in his state of the union
clinton,1,and heres what i would say
clinton,1,i will go anywhere to meet with anyone at any time to find common ground
clinton,1,thats what i did as a first lady when i worked with both democrats and republicans to get the childrens health insurance program when i worked with tom delay one of the most partisan of republicans to reform the adoption and foster care system
clinton,1,what i did working in the senate where i crossed the aisle often working even with the senator from south carolina lindsey graham to get tricare for national guardsmen and women
clinton,1,and its what i did as secretary of state on numerous occasions and most particularly rounding up two thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both russia and the united states
clinton,1,so i know its hard but i also know youve got to work at it every single day
clinton,1,i look out here i see a lot of my friends from the congress
clinton,1,and i know that they work at it every single day
clinton,1,because maybe you cant only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party but who knows
clinton,1,if youre successful there maybe you can build even more
clinton,1,thats what i would do
sanders,0,a couple of years ago when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner i worked with folks like john mccain and others to pass the most comprehensive veterans health care legislation in modern history
sanders,0,but let me rephrase your question because i think in all do respect youre expression
sanders,0,in all do respect youre missing the main point
sanders,0,and the main point in the congress its not the republicans and democrats hate each other
sanders,0,thats a mythology from the media
sanders,0,the real issue is that congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the american people want them to do
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,the real issue is that in area after area raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour
sanders,0,the american people want it
sanders,0,rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure creating 13 million jobs the american people want it
sanders,0,the pay equity for women the american people want it
sanders,0,demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes
sanders,0,the american people want it
sanders,0,the point is we have to make congress respond to the needs of the people not big money
sanders,0,i do
sanders,0,did i say that
sanders,0,because of what i believe in what i was just saying
sanders,0,the democratic party needs major reform
sanders,0,to those of you in south carolina you know what in mississippi we need a 50 state strategy so that people in south carolina and mississippi can get the resources that they need
sanders,0,instead of being dependent on super pacs what we need is to be dependent on small individual campaign contributors
sanders,0,we need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low income people
sanders,0,not wealthy campaign contributors
sanders,0,we need to expand what the input into the democratic party
sanders,0,i am very proud that in this campaign we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people from working people
sanders,0,we have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,yes but senator you never came to campaign for vincent sheheen when he was running for governor
o'malley,0,in fact neither of you came to campaign for vincent sheheen when he was running for governor
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,we can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger democratic party but lester the question you answered its no laughing matter
o'malley,0,the most recurring question i get when i stand on the chair all across iowa and talk with my neighbors is how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country
o'malley,0,this is the biggest challenge we face as a people
o'malley,0,all my life i brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds and thats what we need now in a new leader
o'malley,0,we cannot keep talking past each other declaring all republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires or its all against american muslims all against immigrants
o'malley,0,look as frederick douglas said we are one our cause is one and we must help each other if we are going to succeed
sanders,0,and i respectfully disagree
sanders,0,and i respectfully disagree with my friend over here
sanders,0,and that is you are right
sanders,0,all of us have denounced trumps attempts to divide this country the anti latino rhetoric the racist rhetoric he anti muslim rhetoric
sanders,0,but where i disagree with you governor omalley is i do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires
o'malley,0,i agree with that
sanders,0, who control economic and political life of this country
o'malley,0,i agree
sanders,0,nothing real will get happened
sanders,0,unless we have a political revolution
sanders,0,where millions of people finally stand up
clinton,1,well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on youtube thats quite an accomplishment
clinton,1,look this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people
clinton,1,ive laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that i talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing
clinton,1,so making community college free making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted republican assault on voting rights on womens rights on gay rights on civil rights on workers rights
clinton,1,and i know how much young people value their independence their autonomy and their rights
clinton,1,so i think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how were going to encourage even more americans to vote because it absolutely clear to me
clinton,1,that turning over our white house to the republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people
clinton,1,look i have the greatest respect for senator sanders and for his supports and im going to keep working as hard as i can to reach as many people of all ages about what i will do what the experience and the ideas that i have that i will bring to the white house and i hope to have their support when im the democratic nominee
sanders,0,is that your strategy
sanders,0,well the first difference is i dont take money from big banks
sanders,0,i dont get personal speaking fees from goldman sachs
sanders,0,what i would do applause
sanders,0,what i would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the gdp of america it is very clear to me what you have to do
sanders,0,youve got to bring back the 21st century glass steagall legislation and youve got to break up these huge financial institutions
sanders,0,they have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy
sanders,0,if teddy roosevelt were alive today the old republican trust buster what he would say is these guys are too powerful
sanders,0,break them up
sanders,0,i believe thats what the american people to want see
sanders,0,thats my view
clinton,1,well theres no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail
clinton,1,we agree on that
clinton,1,but where we disagree is the comments that senator sanders has made that dont just affect me i can take that but hes criticized president obama for taking donations from wall street and president obama has led our country out of the great recession
clinton,1,senator sanders called him weak disappointing
clinton,1,he even in 2011 publicly sought someone to run in a primary against president obama
clinton,1,now i personally believe that president obamas work to push through the dodd frank laughter
clinton,1,the dodd frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes weve had since the 1930s
clinton,1,so im going to defend dodd frank and im going to defend president obama for taking on wall street taking on the financial industry and getting results
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,ok first of all
sanders,0,set the record right
sanders,0,in 2006 when i ran for the senate senator barack obama was kind enough to campaign for me 2008 i did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012 i worked as hard as i could to see that he was reelected
sanders,0,he and i are friends
sanders,0,weve worked together on many issues
sanders,0,we have some differences of opinion
sanders,0,but here is the issue secretary touched on it can you really reform wall street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals
sanders,0,so its easy to say well im going to do this and do that but i have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from wall street
sanders,0,i am very proud i do not have a super pac
sanders,0,i do not want wall streets money
sanders,0,ill rely on the middle class and working families
sanders,0, campaign contributions
clinton,1,you know i think since — since senator standers followed up on this
clinton,1,your profusion of comments about your feelings towards president obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011
clinton,1,but look i have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher more effective and more comprehensive
o'malley,0,thats not true
clinton,1,it builds on the dodd frank — yes it is
clinton,1,it builds on the dodd frank regulatory scheme
o'malley,0,its just not true
clinton,1, but it goes much further because
o'malley,0,oh come on
clinton,1, both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks
clinton,1,lehman brothers aig the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the great recession i go after them
clinton,1,and i can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now and karl rove who started running an ad against me right now funded by money from the financial services sector sure thing im the one they dont want to be up against
clinton,1,applause
o'malley,0,yes thank you
o'malley,0,yes lester what secretary clinton just said is actually not true
o'malley,0,what — i have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of wall street
o'malley,0,i have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic
o'malley,0,look if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist hes just going to keep robbing banks again
o'malley,0,the same thing is true with people in suits
o'malley,0,secretary clinton i have a tremendous amount of respect for you but for you to say theres no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true
o'malley,0,i support reinstituting a modern version of glass  steagall that would include going after the shadow banks requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things
o'malley,0,in prior debates ive heard you even bring up — i mean now you bring up president obama here in south carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with wall street
o'malley,0,in an earlier debate i heard you bring up even the 9 11 victims to defend it
o'malley,0,the truth of the matter is secretary clinton you do not go as far as reining in wall street as i would
o'malley,0,and the fact of the matter is the people of america deserve to have a president thats on their side protecting the main street economy from excesses on wall street
o'malley,0,and were just as vulnerable today
clinton,1,yes well first of all — first of all paul krugman barney frank others have all endorsed my plan
clinton,1,secondly we have dodd frank
clinton,1,it gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose
o'malley,0,and we have never used it
clinton,1,that pose a risk to the financial sector
clinton,1,i want to go further and add to that
clinton,1,and you know governor you have raised money on wall street
clinton,1,you raised a lot of money on wall street when you were the head of the democratic governors association
o'malley,0,yes but i havent gotten a penny this year
clinton,1,and you were
o'malley,0, so somebody please go on to martinomalleycomlaughter
o'malley,0,go on to martinomalleycom send me your checks
o'malley,0,theyre not giving me — zero
clinton,1,yes well the point is that if were going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points we should know whats in dodd frank and whats in dodd frank already gives the president the authoritycrosstalkwith his regulators to make those decisions
sanders,0,let me give you an example of how corrupt — how corrupt this system is
sanders,0,goldman sachs recently fined $5 billion
sanders,0,goldman sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury one on the republicans one under democrats
o'malley,0,say it
sanders,0,the leader of goldman sachs is a billionaire who comes to congress and tells us we should cut social security medicare and medicaid
sanders,0,secretary clinton — and youre not the only one so i dont mean to just point the finger at you youve received over $600000 in speaking fees from goldman sachs in one year
sanders,0,i find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law not one of their executives is prosecuted while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well the last point on this is senator sanders youre the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000 to take the cops off the street to use governor omalleys phrase to make the sec and the commodities futures trading commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives which were one of the main cause of the collapse in 08
clinton,1,so theres plenty
sanders,0,if you want to
clinton,1,theres plenty of problems that we all have to face together
clinton,1,and the final thing i would say were at least having a vigorous debate about reining in wall street
clinton,1,
clinton,1,the republicans want to give them more power and repeal dodd frank
clinton,1,thats what we need to stop applause
sanders,0,anyone who wants to check my record in taking on wall street in fighting against the deregulation of wall street when wall street put billions of dollars in lobbying in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs
sanders,0,they got the government off their backs
sanders,0,turns out that they were crooks and they destroyed our economy
sanders,0,i think its time to put the government back on their backs
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0, yeah
sanders,0, thats true
sanders,0,good
sanders,0,youre right
sanders,0,i want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure create 13 million jobs
sanders,0,we do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the cayman islands and not in some years pay a nickel in taxes
sanders,0,yes i do
sanders,0,i plead guilty
sanders,0,i want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college or university tuition free
sanders,0,and by the way i want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well
sanders,0,how do i pay for it
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i pay for it through a tax on wall street speculation
sanders,0,this country and the middle class bailed out wall street
sanders,0,now it is wall streets time to help the middle class
sanders,0,in fact
o'malley,0,inaudible
sanders,0, we have documented unlike secretary clinton i have documented exactly how i would pay for our ambitious agenda
o'malley,0,andrea
o'malley,0,
o'malley,0,the only person on this stage who has
clinton,1,well i have actually documented every way that im going to pay for what im doing because i think the american public deserves to know
clinton,1,and you can go to my website and actually see that
clinton,1,but there are serious questions about how were going to pay for what we want to see our country do
clinton,1,and im the only candidate standing here tonight who has said i will not raise taxes on the middle class
clinton,1,i want to raise incomes not taxes and im going to do everything i can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition for child care for paid family leave
clinton,1,to help us bring down student debt were going to refinance that student debt saving kids thousands of dollars
clinton,1,yeah and that will also come out of the — some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry
clinton,1,but i will tell you exactly how i pay for everything ive proposedcrosstalk
sanders,0,
sanders,0,here is the main two points
sanders,0,yeah
sanders,0,
sanders,0,i got it
sanders,0,what is correct and im disappointed that secretary clintons campaign has made this criticism
sanders,0,its a republican criticism
sanders,0,secretary clinton does know a lot about healthcare and she understands i believe that a medicare for all single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families
sanders,0,so what we have got to acknowledge and i hope the secretary does is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums
sanders,0,so instead of paying $10000 dollars to blue cross or blue shield yes some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5000 dollars in healthcare costs
sanders,0,a little bit more in taxes do away with private health insurance premiums
sanders,0,its a pretty good deal
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,yeah
sanders,0,no it is not breaking my word
sanders,0,when you are — its one thing to say im raising taxes its another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums
sanders,0,so if i save you $10000 in private health insurance and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total there are huge savings in what your family is spending
o'malley,0,senator im the only person on this stage thats actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years
sanders,0,i was mayor for eight years i did that as well
sanders,0,laughter
o'malley,0,ok
o'malley,0,so that was eight years
o'malley,0,yes
o'malley,0,and senator but i actually did it during a budget down time — i mean during a recession
o'malley,0,and andrea the — i had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of maryland but we invested more in infrastructure more in transportation
o'malley,0,we made our public schools more in america more than five years in a row and went four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuition
o'malley,0,the things that we need to do in our country like debt free college in the next five years like making universal — like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation
o'malley,0,and that is the wealthy among us those making more than a million dollars feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years
o'malley,0,and if we tax earnings from investments on money — namely capital gains — at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better
sanders,0,i think we already are
sanders,0,younger generation understands it instinctively
sanders,0,i was home in burlington vermont on christmas eve the temperature was 65 degrees
sanders,0,people in vermont know whats going on
sanders,0,people who did ice fishing where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand whats going on
sanders,0,im on both the environmental and energy committees
sanders,0,the debate is over
sanders,0,climate change is real
sanders,0,it is already causing major problems
sanders,0,and if we do not act boldly and decisively a bad situation will become worse
sanders,0,it is amazing to me and i think well have agreement on this up here that we have a major party called the republican party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they dont even have the courage the decency to listen to the scientists
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,it is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the united states somebody like trump who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the chinese
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,bottom line is we need to be bold and decisive we can create millions of jobs
sanders,0,we must for the sake of our kids and grandchildren transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy
sanders,0,ive got the most comprehensive legislation in the senate to do that
sanders,0,and as president i will fight to make that happen
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,thank you
o'malley,0,lester on this stage tonight this democratic stage where we actually believe in science
o'malley,0,laughter
o'malley,0,i would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050
o'malley,0,it can be done
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,with solar with wind with new technologies with green buildings this can happen but in all — president obama made us more energy independent but in all of the above strategy didnt land us on the moon we need american ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids
clinton,1,and let me
sanders,0,i think what weve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with iran
sanders,0,understanding that irans behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with their support terrorism the anti american rhetoric that were hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable
sanders,0,on the other hand the fact that weve managed to reach an agreement something that ive very strongly supported that prevents iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war
sanders,0,and that i believe were seeing a fall in our relationships with iran is a very positive step
sanders,0,so if your question is do i want to see that relationship become more positive in the future
sanders,0,yes
sanders,0,can i tell that we should open an embassy in tehran tomorrow
sanders,0,no i dont think we should
sanders,0,but i think the goal has go to be as weve done with cuba to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world
clinton,1,well im very proud of the iran nuclear agreement
clinton,1,i was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office
clinton,1,i was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on iran
clinton,1,it brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement
clinton,1,and so they have been so far following their requirements under the agreement
clinton,1,but i think we still have to carefully watch them
clinton,1,weve had one good day over 36 year and i think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization
clinton,1,and we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement
clinton,1,and then we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in syria yemen iraq and elsewhere
clinton,1,absolutely not
clinton,1,i have a three point plan that does not include american ground forces
clinton,1,it includes the united states leading an air coalition which is what were doing supporting fighters on the ground the iraqi army which is beginning to show more ability the sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and kurdish on both sides of the border
clinton,1,i think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space
clinton,1,so im very committed to both going after isis but also supporting what secretary kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond
sanders,0,as everybody you know this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and i applaud
sanders,0,i know president obamas been getting a lot of criticism on this
sanders,0,i think he is doing the right thing
sanders,0,what the nightmare is which many of my republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of iraq
sanders,0,to get american young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of syria and the middle east would be an unmitigated disaster that as president i will do everything in my power to avoid
o'malley,0,andrea
sanders,0,we should — we should learn — we should learn from king abdullah of jordan one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place
sanders,0,and what abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of islam and that muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries
sanders,0,that is how we destroy isis not with american troops in perpetual warfare
o'malley,0,thank you
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,andrea governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what america does best and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition
o'malley,0,and i believe that president obama is doing the right thing in this case
o'malley,0,we need to learn the lessons from the past
o'malley,0,we do need to provide the special — special ops advisers we need — do need to provide the technical support but over the long term we need to develop new alliances
o'malley,0,we need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines
o'malley,0,and i also want to add one other thing here
o'malley,0,i appreciate the fact that in our debate we dont use the term you hear republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids — kids into combat they keep using the term boots on the ground
o'malley,0,a woman in burlington iowa said to me governor when youre with your colleagues please dont refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in iraq as a pair of boots on the ground
o'malley,0,now we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past
o'malley,0,applause
sanders,0,no
sanders,0,i think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in iraq which i vigorously opposed
sanders,0,not only did i vote against it i helped lead the opposition
sanders,0,and what happened there is yes its easy to get rid of a two bit dictator like saddam hussein but there wasnt the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs
sanders,0,and who rises up
sanders,0,groups like isis
sanders,0,so i think that president obama made a promise to the american people when he ran and he said you know what im going to do my best to bring american troops home
sanders,0,and i supported what he did
sanders,0,our job is to train and provide military support for muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on isis
sanders,0,and one point i want to make here that is not made very often you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region countries like saudi arabia countries like qatar
sanders,0,qatar happens to be the largest — wealthiest country per capita in the world
sanders,0,they have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the united states to do it
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,look i think that the presidents decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome
clinton,1,we were able to get the chemical weapons out
clinton,1,i know from my own experience as secretary of state that we were deeply worried about assads forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in syria but it could very well have affected the surrounding states jordan israel lebanon turkey
clinton,1,so getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal but
clinton,1,well — but — but
clinton,1,i think as commander in chief youve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make
clinton,1,i know a little bit about this having spent many hours in the situation room advising president obama
clinton,1,and i want to just add to something that senator sanders said the united states had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region
clinton,1,if there is any blame to be spread around it starts with the prime minister of iraq who sectarianized his military setting shia against sunni
clinton,1,it is amplified by assad who has waged one of the bloodiest most terrible attacks on his own people 250000 plus dead millions fleeing
clinton,1,causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately by terrorist groups including isis
clinton,1,so i think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region
clinton,1,we have a proxy conflict going on between saudi arabia and iran
clinton,1,you know one of the criticisms ive had of senator sanders is his suggestion that you know iranian troops be used to try to end the war in syria
clinton,1, and go after isis which i dont think would be a good idea
sanders,0,let me just
clinton,1,but overall a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence but we can
sanders,0,ok let me suggestcrosstalk
sanders,0,where secretary clinton and i think i agree with most of what she said
sanders,0,but where i think we do have an honest disagreement is that in the incredible quagmire of syria where its hard to know whos fighting who and if you give arms to this guy it may end up in isis hand the next day
sanders,0,we all know that
sanders,0,and we all know no argument the secretary is absolutely right assad is a butcher of his own people man using chemical weapons against his own people
sanders,0,this is beyond disgusting
sanders,0,but i think in terms of our priorities in the region our first priority must be the destruction of isis
sanders,0,our second priority must be getting rid of assad through some political settlement working with iran working with russia
sanders,0,but the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy isis including russia including iran including our muslim allies to make that the major priority
o'malley,0,but in all of that senator and secretary i think were leaving out something very important here
o'malley,0,and that is that we still dont have the human intelligence overt in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things
o'malley,0,we are walking through this region andrea without the human intelligence that we need
o'malley,0,and we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places
o'malley,0,so we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror
clinton,1,well it would depend on what i got for it and i can tell you what we got in the first term we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the united states and russia
clinton,1,we got permission to resupply our troops in afghanistan by traveling across russia
clinton,1,we got russia to sign on to our sanctions against iran and other very important commitments
clinton,1,so look in diplomacy you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isnt some way you can advance your security and your values
clinton,1,when putin came back in the fall of 2011 it was very clear he came back with a mission
clinton,1,and i began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held and russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom and he cracked down
clinton,1,and in fact accused me of fomenting it
clinton,1,so we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him
clinton,1,well my relationship with him its — its interesting
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1,its one i think of respect
clinton,1,weve had some very tough dealings with one another
clinton,1,and i know that hes someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because like many bullies he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do
clinton,1,and we need to get the europeans to be more willing to stand up i was pleased they put sanctions on after crimea and eastern ukraine and the downing of the airliner but weve got to be more united in preventing putin from taking a more aggressive stance in europe and the middle east
clinton,1,applause
o'malley,0,thank you
o'malley,0,i believe whether its a back door or a front door that the american principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant whether they want to come through the back door or your front door
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,and i also agree lester with benjamin franklin who said no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security
o'malley,0,so were a collaborative people
o'malley,0,we need collaborative leadership here with silicon valley and other bright people in my own state of maryland and around the nsa that can actually figure this out
o'malley,0,but there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms
o'malley,0,and one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant
o'malley,0,i also want to the say that while weve made some progress on the patriot act i do believe that we need an adversarial court system there
o'malley,0,we need a public advocate
o'malley,0,we need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of americans in the information and digital age
o'malley,0,yes lester year in and year out i was the leader of the us 
sanders,0,ok
sanders,0,i just wanted to add in the previous question i voted against the usa patriot act for many of the reasons that governor omalley mentioned
sanders,0,but it is not only the government that we have to worry about it is private corporations
sanders,0,you would all be amazed or maybe not about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the web sites that you access the products that you buy where you are this very moment
sanders,0,and it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology
sanders,0,so yes we have to work with silicon valley to make sure that we do not allow isis to transmit information
sanders,0,right
sanders,0,what we have got to do there is among other things as i was just saying have silicon valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the internet or in other ways by isis is in fact discovered
sanders,0,but i do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the american people
sanders,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,oh were breaking
clinton,1,ok
clinton,1,commercial break
o'malley,0,can i get 30 seconds too
o'malley,0,laughter
sanders,0,can i get 50 seconds
clinton,1,well i wanted to say and ill do it quickly i was very pleased that leaders of president obamas administration went out to silicon valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do consistent with privacy and security
clinton,1,we need better intelligence cooperation we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world
clinton,1,and then weve got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among muslim americans
clinton,1,and it is not only shameful it is dangerous for the kinds of comments youre hearing from the republican side
clinton,1,we need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves and working with muslim americans
clinton,1,applause
o'malley,0,and andrea — andrea — andrea
o'malley,0,andrea when can i get my 30 seconds
clinton,1,that is not what ive heard
clinton,1,let me leave it at that
o'malley,0,andrea i need to talk about homeland security and preparedness
o'malley,0,ever since the attacks of september 11th — 30 seconds
o'malley,0,laughter
o'malley,0,ever since the attacks of september 11th my colleagues democratic and republican mayors democratic and republican governors made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness
o'malley,0,here in the homeland unlike combating isil abroad were almost like its — your bodys immune system
o'malley,0,its able to protect your body against bad bugs not necessarily because it outnumbers them but its better connected — the fusion centers the biosurveillance systems better prepared first responders
o'malley,0,but theres another front in this battle and it is this
o'malley,0,thats the political front and if donald trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith he can start with me and i will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify american muslims
o'malley,0,that can do more damage to our democracy than anycrosstalk
sanders,0,can i get a — can i just get a very brief response
sanders,0,very brief
sanders,0,ok one — and i agree with what the secretary said and what governor omalley said
sanders,0,but heres an issue that we also should talk about
sanders,0,we have a $600 billion military budget
sanders,0,it is a budget larger than the next eight countries
sanders,0,unfortunately much of that budget continues to fight the old cold war with the soviet union
sanders,0,very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting isis and international terrorism
sanders,0,we need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the defense department
clinton,1,well itll start at the kitchen table well see how it goes from there
clinton,1,and iapplauseim going to have the very best advisers that i can possibly have and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husbands leadership and the 90s — especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history — you bet
clinton,1,im going to ask for his ideas im going ask for his advice and im going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas weve got because i do believe as he said everything thats wrong with america has been solved somewhere in america
clinton,1,we just have to do more of it and we have to reach out especially into poor communities and communities of color to give more people their own chance to get ahead
sanders,0,great ideas governor omalley secretary clinton but heres the truth
sanders,0,if you have an administration stacked with wall street appointees it aint going to accomplish very much
sanders,0,so heres a promise that i make — and i mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is — goldman sachs paying a $5 billion fine gives this country in recent history a republican secretary of treasury a democratic secretary of treasury
sanders,0,heres a promise
sanders,0,if elected president goldman sachs is not going to have — bring forth a secretary of treasury for a sanders administration
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i was asked a question
sanders,0,you know one of the things andrea and i — that question annoys me
sanders,0,i cannot walk down the street — secretary clinton knows this — without being told how much i have to attack secretary clinton want to get me on the front pages of the paper id make some vicious attack
sanders,0,i have avoided doing that
sanders,0,trying to run an issue oriented campaign
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i was asked a question
sanders,0,well — then if i dont answer it then theres another front page so its yes
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,and i mean this seriously
sanders,0,you know that
sanders,0,weve been through this
sanders,0,yes his behavior was deplorable
sanders,0,have i ever once said a word about that issue
sanders,0,no i have not
sanders,0,im going to debate secretary clinton governor omalley on the issues facing the american people not bill clintons personal behavior
sanders,0,applause
o'malley,0,yes but were going to have to get 20 minutes to do it so
o'malley,0,laughter
o'malley,0,i believe there are many issues
o'malley,0,i have 60 seconds for this
o'malley,0,there are so many issues that we havent been able to discuss here
o'malley,0,we have not fully discussed immigration reform and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nations now maintaining
o'malley,0,we havent discussed the shameful treatment that the people of puerto rico our fellow americans are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over
o'malley,0,applause
o'malley,0,we havent discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation state failures because of drug traffickers and honduras and guatemala and el salvador
o'malley,0,i guess the bottom line is this look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us
o'malley,0,our belief in the dignity of every person our belief in our own common good
o'malley,0,there is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad
o'malley,0,were on the threshold of a new era of american progress and i believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of american prosperity
o'malley,0,thanks a lot
clinton,1,well lester i spent a lot of time last week being outraged by whats happening in flint michigan and i think every single american should be outraged
clinton,1,weve had a city in the united states of america where the population which is poor in many ways and majority african american has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water
clinton,1,and the governor of that state acted as though he didnt really care
clinton,1,he had request for help and he had basically stone walled
clinton,1,ill tell you what if the kids in a rich suburb of detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it there wouldve been action
clinton,1,so i sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of flint to see what i could to help
clinton,1,i issued a statement about what we needed to do and then i went on a tv
clinton,1,show and i said it was outrageous that the governor hadnt acted and within two hours he had
clinton,1,i want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well secretary clinton was right and what i did which i think is also right is demanded the resignation of governor
sanders,0,a man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power
sanders,0,now we are a great nation — and weve heard a lot of great ideas here tonight
sanders,0,lets be honest and lets be truthful
sanders,0,very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining american democracy
sanders,0,weve got to get rid of super pacs weve got to get rid of citizens united and what weve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes american democracy which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process
sanders,0,to say loudly and clearly that the government of the united states of america belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors
sanders,0,rachel thank you very much
sanders,0,millions of americans are giving up on the political process
sanders,0,and theyre giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged
sanders,0,they are working longer hours for low wages
sanders,0,theyre worried about the future of their kids and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent
sanders,0,not what america is supposed to be about
sanders,0,not the fairness that we grew up believing that america was about
sanders,0,and then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining american democracy where billionaire wall street corporate america can contribute unlimited sums of money into super pacs and into candidates
sanders,0,our job together is to end a rigged economy create an economy that works for all and absolutely overturn citizens united
sanders,0,one person one vote
sanders,0,thats what american democracy is about
clinton,1,well im happy to be here in new hampshire for this debate as we move toward the primary on tuesday
clinton,1,i believe that america has the opportunity to once again live by our values live up to our values in the 21st century but i think that america can only do that if americans can succeed
clinton,1,and there are lots of reasons why americans today are feeling left out and left behind
clinton,1,yes of course the economy has not been working for most americans
clinton,1,yes of course we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game
clinton,1,but theres also the continuing challenges of racism of sexism of discrimination against the lgbt community of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated
clinton,1,i believe that we can get back on the right track
clinton,1,i want to imagine a country where peoples wages reflect their hard work where we have healthcare for everyone and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential
clinton,1,im fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes and im not making promises that i cannot keep
clinton,1,well let me start by saying that senator sanders and i share some very big progressive goals
clinton,1,ive been fighting for universal healthcare for many years and were now on the path to achieving it
clinton,1,i dont want us to start over again
clinton,1,i think that would be a great mistake to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare
clinton,1,i want to build on the progress weve made got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage
clinton,1,and i dont want to rip away the security that people finally have 18 million people now have healthcare preexisting conditions are no longer a bar
clinton,1,so we have a difference
clinton,1,i also believe in affordable college but i dont believe in free college because every expert that i have talked to says look how will you ever control the costs
clinton,1,what i want to do is make sure middle class kids not donald trumps kids get to be able to afford college
clinton,1,i want to get the economy going again
clinton,1,its not just enough about what were against as important as that is
clinton,1,i have a plan to create new jobs manufacturing infrastructure clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power
clinton,1,i also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again
clinton,1,and of course i believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work
clinton,1,but the numbers just dont add up from what senator sanders has been proposing
clinton,1,thats why all of the independent experts all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable
clinton,1,lets go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do
clinton,1,a progressive is someone who makes progress
clinton,1,thats what i intend to do
sanders,0,well i havent quite run for president before
sanders,0,laughter and applause
sanders,0,lets deal with some of the comments that secretary clinton made
sanders,0,and by the way you know sometimes theres a lot of drama here
sanders,0,i have known secretary clinton for 25 years and respect her very much
sanders,0,here is the issue
sanders,0,every major country on earth whether its the uk whether its france whether its canada has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are
sanders,0,so i do not accept the belief that the united states of america cant do that
sanders,0,i do not accept the belief that the united states of america and our government cant stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs
sanders,0,number two in the economy today everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce
sanders,0,this is 2016
sanders,0,when we talk about public education it can no longer be k through 12th grade
sanders,0,i do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free
sanders,0,well how do we pay for that
sanders,0,its an expensive proposition
sanders,0,i do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country which is crushing millions of people
sanders,0,we pay for it in my view by a tax on wall street speculation
sanders,0,the middle class bailed out wall street in their time of need
sanders,0,now it is wall streets time to help the middle class
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,if i could just follow up on that
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,there is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up
clinton,1,the republicans want to repeal the affordable care act i want to improve it
clinton,1,i want to build on it get the costs down get prescription drug costs down
clinton,1,senator sanders wants us to start all over again
clinton,1,this was a major achievement of president obama of our country
clinton,1,it is helping people right now
clinton,1,i am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding
clinton,1,lets make the affordable care act work for everybody
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me
sanders,0, this is a good discussion here
sanders,0,and let me just say this
sanders,0,as secretary clinton may know i am on the health education labor committee
sanders,0,that committee wrote the affordable care act
sanders,0,the idea i would dismantle health care in america while were waiting to pass a medicare for all is just not accurate
sanders,0,the affordable care act has clearly as secretary clinton made the point done a lot of good things but what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall
sanders,0,so i do believe that in the future not by dismantling what we have here—i helped write that bill—but by moving forward rallying the american people i do believe we should have health care for all
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well because i am a progressive who gets things done
clinton,1,and the root of that word progressive is progress
clinton,1,but ive heard senator sanders comments and its really caused me to wonder whos left in the progressive wing of the democratic party
clinton,1,under his definition president obama is not progressive because he took donations from wall street vice president biden is not progressive because she supported keystone senator shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact
clinton,1,even the late great senator paul wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for doma
clinton,1,you know we have differences and honestly i think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country
clinton,1,but if were going to get into labels i dont think it was particularly progressive to vote against the brady bill five times
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i dont think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity
clinton,1,i dont think it was progressive to vote against ted kennedys immigration reform
clinton,1,so we could go back and forth like this but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what weve done and what we will do
clinton,1,thats why i am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress get more jobs with rising incomes get us to universal health care coverage get us to universal pre k paid family leave and the other elements of what i think will build a strong economy that will ensure americans keep making progress
clinton,1,thats what im offering and thats what i will do as president
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,no not at all
sanders,0,heres the reality of american economic life today
sanders,0,the reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process
sanders,0,the reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1 10th of 1 percent
sanders,0,the reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the american peoples needs and desires from what congress is doing
sanders,0,so to my mind what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process stand up and fight back demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution—contributors
sanders,0,now all of the ideas that im talking about they are not radical ideas
sanders,0,making public colleges and universities tuition free that exists in countries all over the world used to exist in the united states
sanders,0,rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the cayman islands and other tax havens
sanders,0,that is not a radical idea
sanders,0,what we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests and the campaign contributors
sanders,0,when we do that we can in fact transform america
sanders,0,let me just pick up on this point
sanders,0,this whole discussion began because i commented not making overall evaluation about the secretary
sanders,0,she was in ohio i think in september or november and she got up and said something like i have been—im paraphrasing i have been criticized because people think im a moderate
sanders,0,well i am a moderate
sanders,0,thats where this came from
sanders,0,it wasnt me paraphrasing her
sanders,0,it is what she said and all that i said was theres nothing wrong with being a moderate
sanders,0,but you cant be a moderate you cant a progressive
sanders,0,in terms of president obama i think if we remember where this country was seven years ago 800000 jobs being lost every month $14 trillion dollar deficit
sanders,0,the worlds financial system on the verge of collapse
sanders,0,i think that president obama vice president biden and the democratic leadership in the house and the senate have done a fantastic job
sanders,0,we are in much better shape than we were seven years ago although my republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago
sanders,0,thats the fact but we still have a very long way to go
sanders,0,do i think president obama is a progressive
sanders,0,yes i do
sanders,0,i disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement
sanders,0,but yes i think he has done an excellent job
clinton,1,well chuck
clinton,1,
clinton,1,if i could you know in the very first debate i was asked am i a moderate or a progressive and i said im a progressive who likes to get things done
clinton,1,cherry picking a quote here or there doesnt change my record of having fought for racial justice having fought for kids rights having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the childrens defense fund
clinton,1,it certainly didnt stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies
clinton,1,before it was called hillarycare—i mean before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare because we took them on and we werent successful but we kept fighting and we got the childrens health insurance program
clinton,1,every step along the way i have stood up and fought and have the scars to prove it
clinton,1,so againapplausei think its important that look i understand senator sanders really trying to distinguish himself
clinton,1,i understand that thats what you do in campaigns but at the same time lets not be—in i think an unfair way making an accusation or making an attack about where i stand and about where ive always stood
clinton,1,it is fair to say senator that in your definition as you being the self proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism i dont know anyone else who fits that definition but i know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the democratic party who have stood up time and time again against special interests against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out
clinton,1,and thats what we ought to be celebrating
clinton,1,lets talk about what we would do as president and commander in chief to make sure the progress continues into the future
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,thats right i mean instead of arguing about definitions lets talk about
clinton,1, well you began it yesterday with your comments
sanders,0, what we should do and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walk
sanders,0,i am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a super pac whos not raising huge sums of money from wall streetapplause and special interests
sanders,0,i am enormously proud
sanders,0,never believed it would happen that we have raised 35 million individual contributions averaging $27 dollars a piece
sanders,0,that is what the political revolution means
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well rachel actually that wasnt accurate
sanders,0,in 1988 the republican did win i believe by 3 points
sanders,0,i came in second
sanders,0,it was 34 31 i think 19 for the democrat
sanders,0,in that race the democrat was the spoiler not me
sanders,0,and it is truelaughter and applauseit is true its not to be denied i am the longest  serving independent in the history of the united states congress
sanders,0,people of vermont sent me to washington as an independent
sanders,0,that is true
sanders,0,but on the other hand i have—when i was in the house for 16 years i caucused with the democrats
sanders,0,in the senate for nine years caucused with the democrats of course
sanders,0,and i was elected by the democrats to be chair of the veterans committee three years ago which im very proud of
sanders,0,and now am the rankings member on the budget committee leader of the democrats in opposition to the majority republicans
sanders,0,i am running for president as a democrat
sanders,0,and if elected not only do i hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities but let me be frank i do want to see major changes in the democratic party
sanders,0,i want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesnt exist now
sanders,0,and you know what i want a 50 state strategy so the democratic party is not just the party of 25 states
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know the person who first put out the idea of a 50 state party strategy is former governor howard dean who is with us tonight
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and im very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected vermonters and former officials
clinton,1,two former governors the current governor the current other senator
clinton,1,i really appreciate that
clinton,1,and i think its because theyve worked with me theyve seen what i do
clinton,1,they know what kind of a colleague i am
clinton,1,they want me as their partner in the white house
clinton,1,and thats exactly what i will do
clinton,1,well get things done together
clinton,1,democrats republicans independents were going to make progress together when im president
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well i dont see it quite like that
sanders,0,i am—will absolutely admit that secretary clinton has the support of far more governors mayors members of the house
sanders,0,she has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her
sanders,0,thats a fact
sanders,0,i dont deny it
sanders,0,but i am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece
sanders,0,that we have had meetings where 25000 30000 people have come out
sanders,0,that our campaign is a campaign of the people by the people and for the people
sanders,0,so rachel yes secretary clinton does represent the establishment
sanders,0,i represent i hope ordinary americans and by the way who are not all that enamored with the establishment but i am very proud to have people like keith ellison and raul grijalva in the house the co chairmen of the house progressive caucus
clinton,1,well look ive got to just jump in here because honestly senator sanders is the only person who i think would characterize me a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment
clinton,1,and ive got to tell you that it isapplauseit is really quite amusing to me
clinton,1,people support me because they know me
clinton,1,they know my lifes work
clinton,1,they have worked with me and many have also worked with senator sanders
clinton,1,and at the end of the day they endorse me because they know i can get things done
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i am not going to make promises i cant keep
clinton,1,i am not going to talk about big ideas like single payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost
clinton,1,a respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year
clinton,1,im not going to tell people that i will raise your incomes and not your taxes and not mean it because i dont want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many many americans to get ahead and stay ahead
clinton,1,that is not my agenda
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,what being part of the establishment is is in the last quarter having a super pac that raised $15 million from wall street that throughout ones life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests
sanders,0,to my mind if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families
clinton,1,yeah but i—i think its fair to really ask whats behind that comment
clinton,1,you know senator sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign
clinton,1,ive tried to keep my disagreements over issues as it should be
clinton,1,but time and time again by innuendo by insinuation there is this attack that he is putting forth which really comes down to—you know anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought
clinton,1,and i just absolutely reject that senator
clinton,1,and i really dont think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you
clinton,1,and enough is enough
clinton,1,if youve got something to say say it directly
clinton,1,but you will not find that i ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that i ever received
sanders,0,what applause
clinton,1,and i have stood up and i have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities and im very proud of that
sanders,0, you know
clinton,1,so i think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out
sanders,0,inaudible
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1, in recent weeks and lets talkbooinglets talk about about the issues
clinton,1,lets talk about the issues that divide us
sanders,0,lets talk about—ok lets talk
clinton,1,and lets—lets
sanders,0, let us talk about issues
clinton,1, we both agree with campaign finance reform
sanders,0,lets talk about issues
clinton,1,i—i worked hard for mccain feingold
sanders,0,lets
clinton,1,i want to reverse citizens united
sanders,0, lets—lets—lets talk about issues
clinton,1,and so—lets talk about issues
sanders,0,lets talk—lets talk about issues all right
sanders,0,lets talk about why in the 1990s wall street got deregulated
sanders,0,did it have anything to do with the fact that wall street provided—spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions
sanders,0,well some people might think yeah that had some influence
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,lets ask why it is that we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow and theres nothing that the government can do to stop it
sanders,0,you think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry
sanders,0,lets talk about climate change
sanders,0,do you think theres a reason why not one republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real and that we need to transform our energy system
sanders,0,do you think it has anything to do with the koch brothers and exxonmobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system
sanders,0,that is what goes on in america
sanders,0,i am not—i likeapplausethere is a reason
sanders,0,you know there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system
sanders,0,and in my view it is undermining american democracy and it is allowing congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country
clinton,1,well you know senator i dont think—i dont
clinton,1,crosstalk applause
clinton,1,
clinton,1,i dont think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests among whom you have named a few than i
clinton,1,and im proud of that
clinton,1,you know when i took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage they went after me with a vengeance
clinton,1,today youve got hedge fund billionaires aligned with karl rove running ads against me to try to get democrats to vote for you
clinton,1,i know this game
clinton,1,im going to stop this game
clinton,1,but while were talking about votes youre the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000 which contributed to the over leveraging of lehman brothers which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy
clinton,1,so i dont know—im not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives
clinton,1,people make mistakes and im certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage
clinton,1,what weve got to do as democrats—what weve got to do as democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems
clinton,1,and what i believe is that i have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done
clinton,1,thats what this election should be about
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,i think as secretary clinton knows there is nobody who fought harder
sanders,0,i was on the house financial committee at that time
sanders,0,i heard the arguments coming from democrats and republicans—robert rubin alan greenspan—about great an idea it would be if we did away with glass steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge
sanders,0,go to youtube today
sanders,0,look up greenspan sanders
sanders,0,listen to what i told them then
sanders,0,i helped lead the effort against deregulation
sanders,0,unfortunately we lost that
sanders,0,the result is—was the worst financial disaster since the great depression
sanders,0,chuck actually we looked at it but it turns out to be a disaster
sanders,0,the way it is structured right now if you make it all the way to california you could do pretty well
sanders,0,but in terms of the early states—iowa new hampshire the other states—it just doesnt work
sanders,0,your point is well taken
sanders,0,i believe in public funding of elections absolutely
sanders,0,but this system is—i dont know if the secretary would agree—is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics
sanders,0,but if the
sanders,0,but chuck it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated
sanders,0,it no longer works
sanders,0,nobody can become president based on that system
sanders,0,so whats the alternative
sanders,0,there are two alternatives
sanders,0,and you know we looked at it
sanders,0,well should we do a super pac but i concluded honestly i dont represent corporate america or billionaires i didnt want it
sanders,0,so the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign
sanders,0,and you know what
sanders,0,we got 35 million individual contributions $27 a piece
sanders,0,i think thats pretty good
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,on the issue of wall street
clinton,1,well you know rachel i think i may not have done the job i should in explaining my record
clinton,1,you know i did—when i left the secretary of states office like so many former officials military leaders journalists others i did go on the speaking circuit
clinton,1,i spoke to heart doctors i spoke to the american camping association i spoke to auto dealers and yes i spoke to firms on wall street
clinton,1,they wanted me to talk about the world what my experience had been as secretary of state
clinton,1,but what i want people to know is i went to wall street before the crash
clinton,1,i was the one saying youre going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages
clinton,1,i called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy
clinton,1,i proposed changes in ceo compensation
clinton,1,i called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created
clinton,1,and i think the best evidence that the wall street people at least know where i stand and where i have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary
clinton,1,they have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads
clinton,1,hedge fund billionaires karl rove another billionaire jumped in
clinton,1,and why are they doing that
clinton,1,these are guys who try to make smart investments
clinton,1,they know my record they know me they know that i say what i believe and i will do it
clinton,1,and i also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them
clinton,1,so i do want people to know that and i think its important for everybody to understand i have a record i have stood firm and i will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me just say this
sanders,0,wall street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country
sanders,0,you have companies like goldman sachs who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors
sanders,0,goldman sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of americans
sanders,0,but this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about
sanders,0,these guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on wall street has been charged with anything after paying in this case of goldman sachs a $5 billion fine
sanders,0,kid gets caught with marijuana that kid has a police record
sanders,0,a wall street executive destroys the economy $5 billion settlement with the government no criminal record
sanders,0,that is what power is about
sanders,0,that is what corruption is about
sanders,0,and that is what has to change in the united states of america
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,if i could let me just say that of course it has to change
clinton,1,it has to change
clinton,1,and thats why i have put forward a plan to do just that
clinton,1,and its been judged to be the toughest most effective and comprehensive one
clinton,1,i have great respect for senator sanderss commitment to try to restore glass steagall
clinton,1,but i do not believe that that is enough
clinton,1,and in fact i dont believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have
clinton,1,you know we now have power under the dodd frank legislation to break up banks
clinton,1,and ive said i will use that power if they pose a systemic risk
clinton,1,but i want to go further because it was investment banks it was insurance companies it was mortgage companies all of which contributed
clinton,1,so lets not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem
clinton,1,we have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed
clinton,1,my plan takes us further and it would do the job
clinton,1,crosstalk applause
sanders,0,i would say that—that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time whether its elizabeth warren or many other economists will tell you that right now yes we do need a 21st century glass steagall legislation
sanders,0,and i would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in america today bigger than they were—significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail i think if teddy roosevelt were alive today a good republican by the way what he would say is break them up they are too powerful economically they are too powerful politically
sanders,0,and that is what i believe and many economists believe
sanders,0,time to break them up
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,look we have a law—look you know i—i appreciate the senators advocacy
clinton,1,we have a law
clinton,1,it was passed
clinton,1,it was signed by president obama
clinton,1,it lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed
clinton,1,and by the way president obama signed that pushed it through even though he took donations from wall street because hes a responsible president
clinton,1,so we have a law in place
clinton,1,if the circumstances warrant it i will certainly use it
clinton,1,and from what you say i know you will as well
clinton,1,but that is not enough
clinton,1,and i keep going back to this because part of the reason the wall street guys are trying so hard to stop me—the hedge fund guys the shadow banking guys—is because ive got their number on all of that
clinton,1,and my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future
clinton,1,you know we cant just fight the last war
clinton,1,weve got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again to hurt the economy and to hurt so many americans
clinton,1,and my plan paul krugman barney frank a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be have said i am exactly on point and the wall street guys actually know that
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,well weve had a number of economists supporting our legislation
sanders,0,and heres where we are
sanders,0,the american people can judge
sanders,0,six largest financial institutions in america today have assets of roughly $10 trillion equivalent to 58 percent of the gdp of the united states of america
sanders,0,that is a lot of money
sanders,0,they issue two thirds of the credit cards and by the way theyre ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards and they write about one third of the mortgages
sanders,0,that is a lot of power for six financial institutions
sanders,0,thats it
sanders,0,i think it is too much power
sanders,0,too much economic power too much political power and the economists that i talk to say we should break them up
clinton,1,i will look into it
clinton,1,i dont know the status but i will certainly look into it
clinton,1,but i can only repeat what is the fact that i spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs
clinton,1,i probably described more times than i can remember how stressful it was advising the president about going after bin laden
clinton,1,my view on this is look at my record
clinton,1,look at what i am proposing and—we have a vigorous agreement here
clinton,1,we both want to reign in the excesses of wall street
clinton,1,i also want to reign in the excesses of johnson controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company and we saved the auto industry and now they want to avoid paying taxes
clinton,1,i want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like valeant and turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on peoples health
clinton,1,now if all were going to talk about is one part of our economy and indeed one streak in our economy were missing the big oil companies
clinton,1,were missing other big energy companies
clinton,1,were missing the big picture and i have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist and i will continue to do that
sanders,0,yeah i do
sanders,0,i agree with much of what the secretary said but madam secretary it is not one streak
sanders,0,wall street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power
sanders,0,thats a fact
sanders,0,and i want to say something and it may sound harsh not to you but to the american people
sanders,0,in a sense in my view the business model of wall street is fraud
sanders,0,its fraud
sanders,0,i believe that corruption is rampant and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the united states government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once if we dont start breaking them up were going to have to bail them out again and i do not want to see that happen
clinton,1, well senator no one wants to see that happen
clinton,1,i mean look i care deeply about this because just like you i have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out who lost their homes who are barely back with their heads above water
clinton,1,this was a disaster for our country and we can never let that happen again
clinton,1,we have no disagreement about this
clinton,1,but i think its a broader target list than just wall street and i believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the american people
clinton,1,and i think i have that kind of experience maybe because theyve beat me up for so many years and i know exactly how to handle them because ive been in the arena with them time and time again
sanders,0,of course i can work with them but lets be clear
sanders,0,when i talked about boeing and i talked about general electric what i was referring to is an outrage
sanders,0,i suspect the secretary agrees request me
sanders,0,right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits multi billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the cayman islands bermuda and other tax havens
sanders,0,and in a given year rachel after making billions of dollars in profit do you know how much theyre paying in taxes to the united states government in a given year
sanders,0,zero
sanders,0,now explain to me how that makes any sense at all
sanders,0,so what i have said with regard to boeing and ge and other multinationals that pay zero taxes you know what were going to do
sanders,0,were going to end that loophole
sanders,0,they are going to pay their fair share of taxes
sanders,0,were going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs
sanders,0,can i work with corporations
sanders,0,are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development
sanders,0,absolutely they are
sanders,0,and we should be proud of them
sanders,0,but on the other hand there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the american worker who have said if i can make another nickel in profit by going to china and shutting down in the united states of america thats what i will do
sanders,0,i will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low income countries around the world rather than in the united states of america
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i think what the president understands and what hes trying to do is that we have to support the arab and kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting
clinton,1,i agree with the president
clinton,1,ive said myself we will not send american combat troops back to either syria or iraq—that is off the table
clinton,1,but we do have special forces we do have trainers we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the united states is leading so that we can try to take out isis infrastructure take out their leadership
clinton,1,and i think that given the threat that isis poses to the region and beyond as we have sadly seen in our own country it is important to keep the iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory to work with the sunni tribes in anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed to work with the kurds to provide them the support but theyre doing the fighting
clinton,1,were doing the support and enabling
clinton,1,and i also think weve got to do more to stop foreign fighters foreign funding and take isis on online as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home
clinton,1,so as i look at what the president it doing it adds up to me
clinton,1,we just have to keep—try to get more support for those people on the ground in syria and iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,i mean of course thats a theoretical question and we dont know what it would be for and we dont know how many numbers there are
clinton,1,i am against american combat troops being in syria and iraq
clinton,1,i support special forces
clinton,1,i support trainers
clinton,1,i support the air campaign
clinton,1,and i think were making some progress
clinton,1,i want to continue to intensify that and thats exactly what the president is doing
sanders,0,ok let me agree with much of what the secretary said but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in iraq which created barbaric organizations like isis
sanders,0,not only did i vote against that war i helped lead the opposition and if you go to my website berniesanderscom you will see the statement that i made in 2002
sanders,0,and it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what i feared would happen the day after saddam hussein was overthrown in fact did happen
clinton,1,if i could—if i could
clinton,1, respectfully add—look we did differ
clinton,1,a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat isis
clinton,1,we have to look at the threats that we face right nowapplauseand we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them
sanders,0,well i think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never  ending perpetual warfare within the quagmire of syria and iraq
sanders,0,and i will do my very best to make sure that that doesnt happen
sanders,0,i agree with the secretary that i think what has to happen—and let me just mention what king abdullah of jordan said
sanders,0,i think he hit the nail on the head
sanders,0,and what he said is essentially the war against isis is a war for the soul of islam
sanders,0,and it must be muslim troops on the ground that will destroy isis with the support of a coalition of major powers—us uk france germany and russia
sanders,0,so our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need the air support they need special forces when appropriate
sanders,0,but at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons not the least of which is that isis would like american combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the muslim world and say look were taking on those terrible americans
sanders,0,the combat on the ground must be done by muslim troops with our support
sanders,0,we must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the middle east
sanders,0,well you cant simply withdraw tomorrow
sanders,0,wish we could and allow you know the taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country
sanders,0,but what we must do and what we have seen in recent months is some progress in iraq where finally the iraqi army which has not been a particularly effective fighting force retook ramadi
sanders,0,isis has lost i think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year
sanders,0,hopefully and you know one cant predict the future that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying isis
clinton,1,oh absolutely
clinton,1,the president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in afghanistan
clinton,1,we have a very cooperative government there with ashraf ghani and his top—his top partner abdullah
clinton,1,and they are doing their very best
clinton,1,and the afghan army is actually fighting
clinton,1,the afghan army is taking heavy losses defending afghan territory
clinton,1,and i would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time i took office as to how much help they continue to need
clinton,1,because its not just the taliban
clinton,1,we now are seeing outposts of you know fighters claiming to be affiliated with isis
clinton,1,so weve got this arc of instability from north africa to south asia and we have to pay close attention to it
clinton,1,and we have to build coalitions something that i did to take on the iranian nuclear program and what i will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks
sanders,0,well thats not quite accurate
sanders,0,i did give a speech at georgetown where i talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy
sanders,0,maybe i shouldnt have combined the two in the same speech because the foreign policy part of it didnt get much attention
sanders,0,so let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue
sanders,0,i think while it is true that the secretary and i voted differently on the war in iraq what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in iraq
sanders,0,and that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president is the united states cannot do it alone
sanders,0,we cannot be the policeman of the world
sanders,0,we are now spending more i believe than the next eight countries on defense
sanders,0,we have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism
sanders,0,so i would say that the key doctrine of the sanders administration would be no we cannot continue to do it alone we need to work in coalition
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,a group of national security experts military intelligence experts issued a very concerning statement about senator sanderss views on foreign policy and national security pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues such as inviting iranian troops into syria to try to resolve the conflict there putting them right at the doorstep of israel
clinton,1,asking saudi arabia and iran to work together when they cant stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment
clinton,1,so i do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when new hampshire voters go on tuesday to cast your vote you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief
clinton,1,and there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that white house from day to day that can pose a threat to the united states or one of our friends and allies and i think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here
sanders,0,off mike i fully fully concede that secretary clinton who was secretary of state for four years has more experience—hat is not arguable—in foreign affairs
sanders,0,but experience is not the only point judgment is
sanders,0,and once again back in 2002 when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in iraq one of us voted the right way and one of us didnt
sanders,0,in terms of iran and in terms of saudi arabia of course they hate each other
sanders,0,thats no great secret
sanders,0,but john kerry who is i think doing a very good job has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by isis
clinton,1,well let me just add that you know ive said this before and im very proud of it that when it comes to judgment having run a hard race against senator obama at the time he turned to me to be secretary of state
clinton,1,and when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration namely whether or not to go after bin laden i was at that table i was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do on that on iran on russia on china on a whole raft of issues
clinton,1,because i know from my own experience that youve got to be ready on day one
clinton,1,there is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today you know to try to just say wait ill get to that when i can
clinton,1,that is just not an acceptable approach
sanders,0,well
clinton,1,absolutely
clinton,1,you know i did put together the coalition to impose sanctions
clinton,1,i actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the iranians
clinton,1,im very pleased we got that nuclear agreement
clinton,1,it puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program
clinton,1,we have to enforce it there have to be consequences attached to it
clinton,1,but that is not our only problem with iran
clinton,1,we have to figure out how to deal with iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world
clinton,1,they are destabilizing governments in the region
clinton,1,they continue to support hezbollah and hamas in lebanon against israel
clinton,1,a lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard
clinton,1,im prepared to do that work but i believe just as i did with imposing the sanctions you have to get action for action
clinton,1,if we were to normalize relations right now we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change iranian behavior
clinton,1,the president doesnt think we should
clinton,1,i certainly dont think we should
clinton,1,i believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in iranian aggression their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us
sanders,0,who said that think we should normalize relations with iran tomorrow
sanders,0,i never said that
sanders,0,i think we should move forward as quickly as we can
sanders,0,and youre right
sanders,0,they are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that
sanders,0,but you know a number of years ago people were saying normal relationship with cuba what a bad and silly idea
sanders,0,theyre communists they are our enemy
sanders,0,well guess what
sanders,0,change has come
sanders,0,so please dont suggest that i think we normalize relations with tehran tomorrow
sanders,0,we dont
sanders,0,but i would like to see us move forward and hopefully some day that will happen
sanders,0,and i would say if i might madam secretary—and you can correct me if im wrong
sanders,0,when you ran against senator obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies
sanders,0,i think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well senator let me just correct the record if i can
clinton,1,you know—let me correct the record
clinton,1,crosstalk
clinton,1,as i—as i certainly recall the question was to meet with without conditions
clinton,1,and youre right i was against that
clinton,1,i was against it then i would be against it now
sanders,0,ok
clinton,1,part of diplomacy the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get and giving something the other side wants
clinton,1,of course youve got to try to make peace with and work with those who are your adversaries but you dont just rush in open the door and say here i am
clinton,1,lets talk and make a deal
clinton,1,thats not the way it works
sanders,0,i think president obama had the right idea and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions
sanders,0,but of course it doesnt do us any good to not talk with our adversaries
clinton,1, well we set conditions on iran
clinton,1,we worked hard to get them established and to be enforced and then we talked
clinton,1,thats exactly the rightcrosstalkand thats what i did with the president so he and i are on the very same page
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,just to set the record straight i very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that iran does not get a nuclear weapon
sanders,0, isis
sanders,0,isis you forgot one
sanders,0, no no
sanders,0, isis would be 
sanders,0,clearly north korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators or maybe just one who seems to be somewhat paranoid
sanders,0,and who had nuclear weapons
sanders,0,and our goal there in my view is to work and lean strongly on china to put as much pressure
sanders,0,china is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for north korea and i think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on china
sanders,0,i worry very much about an isolated paranoid country with atomic bombs
sanders,0,i think clearly we got to work closely with china to resolve the serious problems we have and i worry about putin and his military adventurism in the crimea and the ukraine
sanders,0, no i dont
sanders,0,i worry very very much about an isolated country
sanders,0,thats what makes me nervous
sanders,0,russia lives in the world
sanders,0,china lives in the world
sanders,0,north korea is a very very strange country because it is so isolated and i do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons they have got to be dealt with
sanders,0,dealt with effectively
clinton,1,i havent talked to secretary carter but heres what i would think hes planning
clinton,1,we do have the nuclear weapons agreement with iran thats an enforcement consequence action for action follow on
clinton,1,we have a plan we will watch them we will be vigilant
clinton,1,we do have to worry about north korea
clinton,1,they continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability and theyre working very hard on their ballistic missile capability
clinton,1,and i know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach hawaii if not the west coast
clinton,1,we do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine and constrain them
clinton,1,but what secretary carter is looking at is the constant pressure that russias putting on our european allies
clinton,1,the way that russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post world war ii europe
clinton,1,the way that he is trying to set european countries against one another seizing territory holding it in crimea
clinton,1,beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the baltics
clinton,1,we know that they are deeply engaged in supporting assad because they want to have a place in the middle east
clinton,1,they have a naval base they have an air base in syria
clinton,1,they want to hang on to that
clinton,1,i think what secretary carter is seeing and im glad he is is that we got to get nato back working for the common defense
clinton,1,weve got to do more to support our partners in nato and we have to send a very clear message to putin that this kind of belligerence that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to
clinton,1,the best way to do that is to put more armor in put more money from the europeans in so theyre actually contributing more to their own defense
clinton,1,well first of all im absolutely against privatizing the va
clinton,1,and i am going do everything i can to build on the reforms that senator sanders and others in congress have passed to try to fix whats wrong with the va
clinton,1,there are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best
clinton,1,but youre absolutely right you know rachel this is another part of the koch brothers agenda
clinton,1,theyve actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care specialized care for our veterans
clinton,1,i will fight that as hard as i can
clinton,1,i think theres where we can enlist the veterans service organizations the veterans of america because yes lets fix the va but we will never let it be privatized and that is a promise
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me agree
sanders,0,you know as the secretary knows i chaired—i had the privilege and the honor of chairing the senate committee on veterans affairs
sanders,0,and it is interesting to me you know republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans
sanders,0,i work with the american legion the vfw the dav the vietnam vets and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of america
sanders,0,thats what i did
sanders,0,and i brought it to the floor of the senate
sanders,0,every democrat voted for it i got two republicans
sanders,0,we ended up with 56 votes and i couldnt get the 60 votes that i needed
sanders,0,that is pathetic
sanders,0,this was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them
sanders,0,so republicans talk a good game about veterans but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans frankly they were not there
sanders,0,what i did next rachel is i had to retreat a little bit i had to compromise
sanders,0,i did work with john mccain
sanders,0,i did work with jeff miller over in the house
sanders,0,and we put together not the bill that i wanted but probably the most comprehensive va
sanders,0,health care bill in the modern history of this country
sanders,0,secretary clinton is absolutely right there are people koch brothers among others who have a group called concerned veterans of america funded by the koch brothers
sanders,0,the koch brothers by the way want to destroy social security medicare medicaid every governmental program passed since the 1930s
sanders,0,yes there are people out there who want to privatize it
sanders,0,the last point that id make
sanders,0,i had a hearing
sanders,0,i had all of the veterans groups in front of me
sanders,0,and i said to them tell me when a veteran gets in to the va understanding there are waiting lines and real problems when a veteran gets into the system is the quality of care good
sanders,0,without exception what they said good excellent very good
sanders,0,weve got to strengthen the va
sanders,0,we do not privatize the va
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well i agree with the des moines register but lets not blow this out of proportion
sanders,0,this is not a—this is not like a winner take all thing
sanders,0,i think where we now stand—correct me if im wrong—you have 22 delegates i have 20 delegates
sanders,0,we need 2500 delegates to win the nomination
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,you know so this is not—this is not the biggest deal in the world
sanders,0,we think by the way based on talking to our precinct captains we may have at least two more delegates
sanders,0,what the des moines register said—you know there were coin—i think there were half a dozen coin flips—a fairly chaotic type situation
sanders,0,at the end of the day no matter how its recounted it will break roughly even
sanders,0,and by the way i love and respect the caucus process in iowa
sanders,0,see and i dont have to say it because they voted already
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,and i love new hampshire too because you havent voted butapplausebut look i think people are blowing this up out of proportion
sanders,0,but i think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined
clinton,1,whatever they decide to do thats fine
clinton,1,all right
sanders,0,oh inaudible
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,see when you are old then they go back all these years
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,what have you got
sanders,0,well you know a general election is different than a primary and caucus process
sanders,0,but let me just say this
sanders,0,in terms of where we are right now as you mention rachel in a number of national and state including new hampshire
sanders,0,for example the last poll i saw—there may have been a new one—last one i saw here in new hampshire a battleground state had me defeating trump by 19 the secretary defeating him by one
sanders,0,there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin
sanders,0,these are polls
sanders,0,polls go up
sanders,0,polls go down
sanders,0,but heres why i think i will be if nominated the strongest candidate
sanders,0,democrats win when there is a large voter turnout when people are excited when working people middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process
sanders,0,republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout which by the way is why they love voter suppression
sanders,0,i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people from young people who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout
sanders,0,if there is a large voter turnout not only do we retain the white house but i think we regain the senate
sanders,0,we win governors chairs up and down the line
sanders,0,so i believe if you want to retain the white house if you want to see democrats do well across the board i think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i can only tell you what i believe and that is that i am the strongest candidate to take it to the republicans and win in november
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and i say that with great—with great respect for the campaign that senator sanders has been running
clinton,1,i personally am thrilled at the numbers of people and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign
clinton,1,i hope that i will be able to earn their support
clinton,1,they may not support me now but i support them and well work together
clinton,1,but what im concerned about is the views of many democrats who know their states who know how hard it is to win a general election
clinton,1,and it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight
clinton,1,ive been vetted
clinton,1,theres hardly anything you dont know about me
clinton,1,and i think its fair to say that whoever is in that position senator sanders or anyone else who might have run will face the most withering onslaught
clinton,1,so i think that i am the person who can do all aspects of the job
clinton,1,i think im the person best prepared to take the case to the republicans
clinton,1,and i think that at the end of the day its not so much electability
clinton,1,it is who the american people can believe can keep them safe can get the economy moving again can get incomes rising can build on the progressive accomplishments of president obama
clinton,1,and i think that the coalition that president obama put together to win twice is a coalition that i can put together and add to
clinton,1,and thats what im prepared to applause
clinton,1,crosstalk
clinton,1,absolutely i can
clinton,1,you know before it was emails it was benghazi and the republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that
clinton,1,and i testified for 11 hours answered their questions
clinton,1,they basically said yeah didnt get her
clinton,1,we tried
clinton,1,that was all a political ploy
clinton,1,now we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that secretary powell and close aides to former secretary rice used private e mail accounts
clinton,1,and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to secretary powell and secretary rices aide theyve been doing to me which is that i never sent or received any classified material
clinton,1,they are retroactively classifying it
clinton,1,i agree completely with secretary powell who said today this is an absurdity
clinton,1,and so i think the american people will know its an absurdity
clinton,1,i have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i am 100 percent confident
clinton,1,this is a security review that was requested
clinton,1,it is being carried out
clinton,1,it will be resolved
clinton,1,but i have to add if theres going to be a security review about me theres going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people including republican office holders because weve got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications
clinton,1,honest to goodness this is—this just beggars the imagination
clinton,1,so i have absolutely no concerns about it but weve got to get to the bottom of whats really going on here and i hope that will happen
sanders,0,off mike
sanders,0,i am feeling exactly the way i felt at the first debate
sanders,0,theres a process under way
sanders,0,i will not politicize it
sanders,0,and by the way—and by the way if i may the secretary probably doesnt know that theres not a day that goes by when i am not asked to attack her on that issue and i have refrained from doing that and i will continue to refrain from doing that
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,not losing control of our campaign
sanders,0,you know we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and i am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable and we have apologized and dealt with that
sanders,0,in terms of the last one as i understand it we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper
sanders,0,newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates and to the best of my knowledge that is what we did
sanders,0,so we never said never said that somebody a newspaper endorsed us that did not
sanders,0,what we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper
sanders,0,but that was only for—that was not to be on television
sanders,0,thats an important point
sanders,0,that was just something—as the secretary knows you put titles on ads and you send them out but there was no word in that ad none that said that those newspapers had endorsed us
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,yes i do
clinton,1,and—you know what i hope the supreme court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that to me is the real dividing line
clinton,1,i have much more confidence in the federal system and i do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system like terrorism
clinton,1,i have strong feelings about that
clinton,1,i thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that timothy mcveigh received the death penalty for blowing up the federal building in oklahoma city killing 168 people including 19 children in a daycare center
clinton,1,i do for very limited particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment but i deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it
clinton,1,if it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the supreme court that would i think be an appropriate outcome
sanders,0, look i hear what the secretary said and i understand but look there are—all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible horrible crimes
sanders,0,its hard to imagine how people can do bomb and kill 168 people in oklahoma city or do the boston marathon bombing but this is what i believe and for a couple of reasons
sanders,0,number one too many innocent people including minorities african americans have been executed when they were not guilty
sanders,0,thats number one
sanders,0,we have to be very careful about making sure about that
sanders,0,but second of all and maybe in a deeper reason of course there are barbaric acts out there
sanders,0,but in a world of so much violence and killing i just dont believe that government itself should be part of the killing
sanders,0,so when somebody commitsapplausesomebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen you lock them up and you toss away the key
sanders,0,theyre never going to get out
sanders,0,but i just dont want to see government be part of killing
sanders,0,thats all
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,absolutely
clinton,1,absolutely
clinton,1,you know rachel you and i have talked about this before
clinton,1,i thank you for going to flint to hold that town hall
clinton,1,i will be in flint at the mayors invitation on sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is and is not happening
clinton,1,this is an emergency
clinton,1,everyday that goes by that these people particularly the children are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a childs life
clinton,1,i know from the work that ive done over so many years lead the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development your body development your behavior
clinton,1,i absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient
clinton,1,we need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of flint are barring
clinton,1,that includes fixing their pipes it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward and i think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of michigan
clinton,1,if michigan wont do it there have to be ways that we can begin to move and then make them pay for it and hold them accountable
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,i think the secretary described the situation appropriately
sanders,0,you know i dont go around asking for governors resignations every day
sanders,0,in fact i think i never have in my life
sanders,0,but i did ask for the resignation of governor snyder because his irresponsibilityapplausewas so outrageous
sanders,0,what we are talking about are children being poisoned
sanders,0,thats what were talking about
sanders,0,we dont know no one knows for sure because they havent done the appropriate studies but theres no question that kids intellectual development may have been impacted
sanders,0,we dont know how many thousands
sanders,0,the idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension
sanders,0,and when you have one of the i think significant public health crises of recent years of course the federal government comes in
sanders,0,and of course the federal government says youre not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives
sanders,0,last point on this
sanders,0,and i suspect the secretary agrees
sanders,0,one wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,flint michigan is a poor community
sanders,0,it is disproportionately african american and minority
sanders,0,and what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable
clinton,1,you know chuck ive only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator
clinton,1,and i voted a multinational trade agreement when i was senator the cafta agreement because i did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of america of our incomes and i opposed it
clinton,1,i did hope that the tpp negotiated by this administration would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements
clinton,1,and i said that i was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that i was looking for
clinton,1,i waited until it had actually been negotiated because i did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration
clinton,1,once i saw what the outcome was i opposed it
clinton,1,now i have a very clear view about this
clinton,1,we have to trade with the rest of the world
clinton,1,we are 5 percent of the worlds population
clinton,1,we have to trade with the other 95 percent
clinton,1,and trade has to be reciprocal
clinton,1,thats the way the global economy works
clinton,1,but we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that american workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy
clinton,1,so its not just whats in the trade agreement that im interested in
clinton,1,i did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from president bush with korea
clinton,1,we go the uaw on board because of changes we made
clinton,1,so there are changes that i believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved but i do not currently support it as it is written
sanders,0,absolutely right
sanders,0,chuck i believe in trade but i do not believe in unfettered free trade
sanders,0,i believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations
sanders,0,i was not only in opposition to nafta—and this is an area where the secretary and i have disagreements
sanders,0,i was not only in opposition to nafta i was on the picket line in opposition to nafta because i understood—i dont think this is really rocket science
sanders,0,we heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created
sanders,0,i didnt believe that for a second because i understood what the function of nafta cafta pntr with china and the tpp is its to say to american workers hey you are now competing against people in vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage
sanders,0,i dont want american workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour
sanders,0,i dont want companies shutting down in america throwing people out on the street moving to china and bringing their products back into this country
sanders,0,so do i believe in trade
sanders,0,of course i believe in trade
sanders,0,but the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate america for corporate america resulted in the loss of millions of decent paying jobs 60000 factories in america lost since 2001 millions of decent paying jobs and also a downward spiral a race to the bottom where employers say hey you dont want to take a cut in pay
sanders,0,were going to china
sanders,0,workers today are working longer hours for lower wages
sanders,0,trade is one of the reasons for that
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i—i dont accept that premise chuck
clinton,1,i think that weve got so much business we have to do
clinton,1,weve talked a lot tonight about what were against—were against income inequality
clinton,1,were against the abuses of powerful interests
clinton,1,were against a lot of things
clinton,1,im for a lot of things
clinton,1,i dont want to just stop bad things from happening i want to start good things from happening
clinton,1,and i believe if im so fortunate to get the nomination i will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda beginning to talk with members of congress and others about how we can push forward
clinton,1,i want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed the first four years
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years
clinton,1,i want us to keep working on the affordable care act to get not only to 100 percent coverage but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out of pocket costs
clinton,1,i want to move forward on paid family leave on early childhood education i want us to do more for small businesses
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,small businesses have to create most of the jobs and were not creating and growing small businesses
clinton,1,i think if you have a smart agenda you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces—because thats the way congress is set up
clinton,1,you go through different committees and you really make a big push in the beginning
clinton,1,immigration reform economic revitalization with manufacturing with infrastructure—we put it out there and we begin to work on an ambitious big bold agenda that will actually produce the results that i want to see for our country
sanders,0,no let
sanders,0,
sanders,0,i am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,we got to do that
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,but you miss—when you looked at the issues you missed two of the most important
sanders,0,and that is youre not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,so long as big money interests control the united states congress it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families
sanders,0,so let me be very clear
sanders,0,no nominee of mine if im elected president to the united states supreme court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear and says they will vote to overturn citizens united
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,second point—second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which today allows us to have more people in jail than any other country—largely african american and latino—the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share is when millions of people become involved in the political process
sanders,0,no you just cant negotiate with mitch mcconnell
sanders,0,mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying mitch stop representing the billionaire class
sanders,0,start listening to working families
sanders,0,and as president thats what i will work hard on
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,the answer to both of those is no
clinton,1,im interested in making what we have work better
clinton,1,i want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant
clinton,1,i want to have a top to bottom review about what works and what doesnt work and be absolutely clear were getting rid of what doesnt work
clinton,1,i have had the opportunity to run a big agency
clinton,1,i was very flattered when henry kissinger said i ran the state department better—better than anybody had run it in a long time
clinton,1,so i have an idea of what its going to take to make our government work more efficiently
clinton,1,and when you put together a budget you have to make a lot of hard decisions but i think its not appropriate to say im going to get rid of this get rid of that until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do
clinton,1,but i want to add something else you know because look we have so much work to do in our country and i think its the greatest work that americans will be called to do
clinton,1,and of course we have to have people in every community involved in it
clinton,1,we have to have the political voice the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in washington
clinton,1,but we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve and we need to level with the american people about what they are what they will cost what will be expected of our citizenry
clinton,1,so i see as president having a constant dialogue with americans heres what were trying to get done heres why i need your help heres why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isnt something you care about but im telling you it will help fix the labor market it will bring people out of the shadows—
clinton,1,clinton—it will actually raise wages
clinton,1,you have to make all those connections so that youve got people with you every step of the way
clinton,1,thats what i want to do
clinton,1,i never said that
clinton,1,look
clinton,1,well im certainly going to unite the party but im not—im not getting ahead of myself
clinton,1,i think that would be a little bit presumptuous
clinton,1,if im so fortunate as to be the nominee the first person i will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be senator sanders
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,i agree with what the secretary said
sanders,0,we shouldnt be getting ahead of ourselves
sanders,0,and as i have said many times you know sometimes in these campaigns things get a little bit out of hand
sanders,0,i happen to respect the secretary very much i hope its mutual
sanders,0,and on our worst days i think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any republican candidate
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,thats true
clinton,1,thats true
clinton,1,crosstalk
clinton,1,well first thanks to msnbc and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the new hampshire primary
clinton,1,i am going to campaign as hard as i can between now and tuesday to earn your votes in that primary and i hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart do they vote with their head im asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved
clinton,1,you know we didnt get to talk about the continuing struggles that americans face with racism with sexism with discrimination against the lgbt community with new americans with people with disabilities
clinton,1,yes we have income inequality we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society
clinton,1,so i have been moved by my heart ever since i was a young woman about the age of a lot of senator sanders supporters worrying what i can do to make a difference for my country and i will bring that heart with me but i will also tell you weve got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,i—my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from poland
sanders,0,didnt have any money couldnt speak english he died pretty young and i think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president
sanders,0,i love this country and my dad loved this country and he was the most proud american because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family even though we never had much money
sanders,0,but today in america we are the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all people that doesnt guarantee paid family and medical leave
sanders,0,we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth
sanders,0,we are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the united states of america
sanders,0,im running for president because i believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics
sanders,0,i do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors
sanders,0,thank you all
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,thank you
sanders,0,well gwen and judy thank you very much for hosting this event
sanders,0,and pbs thank you
sanders,0,nine months ago our campaign began
sanders,0,and when it began we had no political organization no money and not much name recognition outside of the state of vermont
sanders,0,a lot has happened in nine months
sanders,0,and what has happened is i think the american people have responded to a series of basic truths and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt which is undermining american democracy which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice
sanders,0,and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy
sanders,0,and thats an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers
sanders,0,they are worried to death about the future of their kids
sanders,0,and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent
sanders,0,and then in addition to that the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system
sanders,0,they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth 22 million
sanders,0,were spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow americans
sanders,0,they see kids getting arrested for marijuana getting in prison getting a criminal record while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all
sanders,0,no criminal records for them
sanders,0,i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics tired of establishment economics
sanders,0,they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up come together not let the trumps of the world divide us and say you know what in this great country we need a government that represents all of us not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors
sanders,0,thank you
clinton,1,im running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding americans back and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every american a chance to advance especially those who have been left out and left behind
clinton,1,i know a lot of americans are angry about the economy
clinton,1,and for good cause
clinton,1,americans havent had a raise in 15 years
clinton,1,there arent enough good paying jobs especially for young people
clinton,1,and yes the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top
clinton,1,we both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that wall street never wrecks main street again
clinton,1,but i want to go further
clinton,1,i want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many americans right now
clinton,1,african americans who face discrimination in the job market education housing and the criminal justice system
clinton,1,hardworking immigrant families living in fear who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future
clinton,1,guaranteeing that womens work finally gets the pay the equal pay that we deserve
clinton,1,i think america can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every american has a chance to live up to his or her potential
clinton,1,that will be my mission as president
clinton,1,and i think together we will make progress
sanders,0,well to put that in a context judy i think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled
sanders,0,in other words the very rich are getting richer almost everybody is going — getting poorer
sanders,0,what i believe is the united states in fact should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people
sanders,0,our medicare for all single payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5000 a year
sanders,0,i do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free
sanders,0,i believe that when real unemployment is close to 10% and when our infrastructure our roads our bridges our water systems flint michigan comes to mind
sanders,0,our waste water plants our rail our airports in many places are disintegrating
sanders,0,yeah we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars
sanders,0, of course there will be a limit but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality when the middle class is disappearing you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on earth
sanders,0,yes in my view the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living
clinton,1,judy i think that the best analysis that ive seen based on senator sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40% but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans — lets take healthcare for example
clinton,1,last week in a cnn town hall the senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5000 dollars in healthcare
clinton,1,every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers dont add up and thats a promise that cannot be kept and its really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because especially with healthcare this is not about math
clinton,1,this is about peoples lives and we should level with the american people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare
sanders,0,well let us level with the american people
sanders,0,secretary clinton has been going around the country saying bernie sanders wants to dismantle the affordable care act people are going to lose their medicaid theyre going to lose their chip program
sanders,0,i have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people
sanders,0,were not going to dismantle everything
sanders,0,but here is the truth
sanders,0,twenty nine million people have no health insurance today in america
sanders,0,we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs
sanders,0,one out of five americans cant even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing
sanders,0,millions of people have high deductibles and co payments
sanders,0,what i said and let me repeat it i dont know what economists secretary clinton is talking to but what i have said and let me repeat it that yes the middle — the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5000 dollars
sanders,0,in my view healthcare is a right of all people not a privilege and i will fight for that
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage
clinton,1,you know before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare
clinton,1,and i took on the drug companies and i took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage
clinton,1,applause and why i am a staunch supporter of president obamas principal accomplishment — namely the affordable care act — is because i know how hard it was to get that done
clinton,1,we are at 90 percent coverage
clinton,1,we have to get the remaining 10
clinton,1,ive set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down especially prescription drug costs
clinton,1,and it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share
clinton,1,but i think the american people deserve to know specifically how this would work
clinton,1,if its medicare for all then you no longer have the affordable care act because the affordable care act as you know very well is based on the insurance system based on exchanges based on a subsidy system
clinton,1,the childrens health insurance program which i helped to create which covers 8 million kids is also a different kind of program
clinton,1,so if youre having medicare for all single payer you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing
clinton,1,and based on every analysis that i can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal the numbers dont add up and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now
sanders,0,that is absolutely inaccurate
sanders,0,look here is the reality folks
sanders,0,there is one major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people
sanders,0,there is one major country — the united states — which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the uk guaranteeing health care to all people 50 percent more than they do in france guaranteeing health care to all people far more than our canadian neighbors who guarantee health care to all people
sanders,0,please do not tell me that in this country if — and heres the if — we have the courage to take on the drug companies and have the courage to take on the insurance companies and the medical equipment suppliers if we do that yes we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way
clinton,1,well let me just — let me just say once againapplausethat having been in the trenches fighting for this i believe strongly we have to guarantee health care
clinton,1,i believe we are on the path to doing that
clinton,1,the last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again
clinton,1,and we are not england
clinton,1,we are not france
clinton,1,we inherited a system that was set up during world war ii 170 million americans get health insurance right now through their employers
clinton,1,so what we have tried to do and what president obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have get us to 90 percent coverage
clinton,1,we have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100
clinton,1,i far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again gridlocking our system and trying to get from zero to 100 percent
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,no
clinton,1,but it is absolutely fair and necessary for americans to vet both of our proposals to ask the really hard questions about what is it we think we can accomplish why do we believe that and what would be the results for the average american family
clinton,1,in my case whether its health care or getting us to debt free tuition or moving us toward paid family leave i have been very specific about where i would raise the money how much it would cost and how i would move this agenda forward
clinton,1,ive tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted because i feel like we have to level with people for the very reason gwen that you are mentioning
clinton,1,there is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government
clinton,1,im aware of that
clinton,1,it comes from the right from the left from people on all sides of the political spectrum
clinton,1,so we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for which is why i think we should not make promises we cant keep because that will further i think alienate americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in peoples lives
clinton,1,i will put a price tag
clinton,1,my price tag is about $100 billion a year
clinton,1,and again paid for
clinton,1,and what i have said is i will not throw us further into debt
clinton,1,i believe i can get the money that i need by taxing the wealthy by closing loopholes the things that we are way overdue for doing
clinton,1,and i think once im in the white house we will have enough political capital to be able to do that
clinton,1,but i am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear especially with young people about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost
sanders,0,well secretary clinton youre not in the white house yet
sanders,0,and let us be clear that every proposal that i have introduced has been paid for
sanders,0,for example all right who in america denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling
sanders,0,roads bridges water systems wastewater plants who denies that
sanders,0,who denies that real unemployment today including those who have given up looking for work and are working part time is close to 10 percent
sanders,0,who denies that african american youth unemployment real is over 50 percent
sanders,0,we need to create jobs
sanders,0,so yes i will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the cayman islands and bermuda and in a given year pay zero zero in federal income tax
sanders,0,yes im going to do away with that
sanders,0,we will use those proceeds a hundred billion a year to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure
sanders,0,yes i believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on wall street that they are a wall street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the great recession — great depression
sanders,0,yes i do believe that now after the american people bailed wall street out yes they should pay a wall street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition free
sanders,0,we bailed them out
sanders,0,now it is their time to help the middle class
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know i think again both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young americans
clinton,1,and i have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt free tuition
clinton,1,we differ however on a couple of key points
clinton,1,one of them being that if you dont have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students its hard to get to where we need to go
clinton,1,and senator sanderss plan really rests on making sure that governors like scott walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free
clinton,1,i am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,a brief response
sanders,0,here is where we are with public education
sanders,0,a 100 150 years ago incredibly brave americans said you know what working class kids low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms
sanders,0,like rich kids they deserve to get a free education
sanders,0,and that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade
sanders,0,the world has changed
sanders,0,this is 2016
sanders,0,in many ways a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 60 years ago
sanders,0,so yes i do believe that when we talk about public education in america today in a rapidly changing world we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities
sanders,0,that should be a right of all americans regardless of the income of their families
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well first judy i have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices even if that choice is not to vote for me
clinton,1,i believe that its most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society
clinton,1,and i feel very strongly that i have an agenda i have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face
clinton,1,so im going to keep making that case
clinton,1,im going to keep making sure that everything ive done everything that i stand for is going to be well known
clinton,1,but i have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support
clinton,1,i just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me
clinton,1,thats what im working towards
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well look i think that shes been saying that for as long as ive known her which is about 25 years
clinton,1,but it doesnt change my view that we need to empower everyone women and men to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make
clinton,1,thats what ive always stood for
clinton,1,and when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether were going to have equal pay paid family leave some opportunity for you know women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them i think that we still have some barriers to knock down which is why thats at the core of my campaign
clinton,1,i would note just for a historic aside somebody told me earlier today weve had like 200 presidential primary debates and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage
clinton,1,so you know well take our progress wherever we can find it
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,look we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women from men straight gay african americans latinos asian americans
sanders,0,we are trying to bring america together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class
sanders,0,i am very proud if my memory is not correct — i think i am — that i have a lifetime — and ive been in congress a few years — a lifetime 100 percent pro choice voting record
sanders,0,i am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of vermont from very significant majorities of women
sanders,0,im very proud that i support legislation that is currently in the congress got support of almost all progressive democrats in the house and senate which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men
sanders,0,and we will join the rest of the other — the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well you know i think from a historical point of view somebody with my background somebody with my views somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests i think a sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know i have said — i have said many times you know im not asking people to support me because im a woman
clinton,1,im asking people to support me because i think im the most qualified experienced and ready person to be the president and the commander in chief
clinton,1,applause and i appreciate greatly senator sanders voting record
clinton,1,and i was very proud to get the endorsement of the planned parenthood action fund because ive been a leader on these issues
clinton,1,i have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep womens health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves
clinton,1,im very proud that naral endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on womens issues
clinton,1,somebody who yes votes right but much more than that leads the efforts to protect the hard fought gains that women have made that make no mistake about it are under tremendous attack not just by the republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back womens rights
clinton,1,so im asking women im asking men to support me because im ready to go into the white house on january 20th 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me concur with the secretary no question womens rights are under fierce attack all over this country
sanders,0,and i will tell you something that really galls me
sanders,0,i will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy
sanders,0,just a little bit
sanders,0,all over this country we have republican candidates for president saying we hate the government
sanders,0,government is the enemy
sanders,0,were going to cut social security to help you
sanders,0,were going to cut medicare and medicaid federal aid to education to help you because the government is so terrible
sanders,0,but by the way when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice ah in that case my republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in america
sanders,0,if thats not hypocrisy i dont know what hypocrisy is
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,this is one of the great tragedies in our country today
sanders,0,and we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug
sanders,0,it has to be dealt with
sanders,0,today a male african american baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in jail
sanders,0,that is beyond unspeakable
sanders,0,so what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,what we have to do is end over policing in african american neighborhoods
sanders,0,the reality is that both the african american community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates
sanders,0,the reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana
sanders,0,truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations
sanders,0,the truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites
sanders,0,we need fundamental police reform clearly clearly when we talk about a criminal justice system
sanders,0,i would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people often african americans shot by police officers
sanders,0,what we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will in fact be held accountable
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know i completely agree with senator sanders
clinton,1,the first speech i gave in this campaign back in april was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration
clinton,1,the statistics from wisconsin are particularly troubling because it is the highest rate of incarceration for african americans in our nation twice the national average
clinton,1,and we know of the tragic terrible event that lead to the death of dontre hamilton right here in milwaukee a young man unarmed who should still be with us
clinton,1,his family certainly believes that
clinton,1,and so do i
clinton,1,so we have work to do
clinton,1,there have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen
clinton,1,president obamas policing commission came out with some
clinton,1,i have fully endorsed those
clinton,1,but we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect
clinton,1,and then we have to go after sentencing and thats one of the problems here in wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesnt happen at the federal level it happens at the state and local level
clinton,1,but i would also add this
clinton,1,there are other racial discrepancies
clinton,1,really systemic racism in this state as in others education in employment in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people particularly young men are pushed out of school early are denied employment opportunities
clinton,1,so when we talk about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration we also have to talk about jobs education housing and other ways of helping communities
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,nothing that secretary clinton said do i disagree with
sanders,0,this mandatory sentencing a very bad idea
sanders,0,it takes away discretion from judges
sanders,0,we have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies
sanders,0,applause we have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity
sanders,0,and where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see
sanders,0,people are being released from jail without the education without the job training without the resources that they need to get their lives together then they end up — were shocked that they end up back in jail again
sanders,0,so we have a lot of work to do
sanders,0,but here is a pledge ive made throughout this campaign and its really not a very radical pledge
sanders,0,when we have more people in jail disproportionately african american and latino than china does a communist authoritarian society four times our size
sanders,0,heres my promise at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country
sanders,0,we will invest in education and jobs for our kids not incarceration and more jails
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well im just not sure i agree completely with that assessment
clinton,1,i think under president obama we have seen a lot of advances the affordable care act has helped more african americans than any other group to get insurance to be taken care of but we also know a lot more than we did
clinton,1,we have a lot more social media we have everybody with a cellphone
clinton,1,so we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society
clinton,1,i think president obama has set a great example
clinton,1,i think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult but he has gone forward
clinton,1,now what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next
clinton,1,we now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system
clinton,1,we now have some good models about how better to provide employment housing and education
clinton,1,i think what president obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first african american president and to address it both from the presidents office and through his advocacy such as working with young men and mrs obamas work with young women
clinton,1,but we cant rest
clinton,1,we have work to do and we now know a lot more than we ever did before
clinton,1,so its going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open
clinton,1,nobody can deny them
clinton,1,to use the justice department as we just saw they have said they are going to sue ferguson that entered into a consent agreement and then tried to back out
clinton,1,so were going to enforce the law were going to change policing practices were going to change incarceration practices but were also going to emphasize education jobs and housing
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well i think judy what has to be appreciated is that as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on wall street millions of lives were hurt
sanders,0,people lost their jobs their homes their life savings
sanders,0,turns out that the african american community and the latino community were hit especially hard
sanders,0,as i understand it the african american community lost half of their wealth as a result of the wall street collapse
sanders,0,so when you have childhood african american poverty rates of 35 percent when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration — which by the way leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother — clearly we are looking at institutional racism
sanders,0,we are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer
sanders,0,and sadly in america today in our economy a whole lot of those poor people are african american
sanders,0,absolutely because what we will do is say instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we are going to create millions of jobs for low income kids so theyre not hanging out on street corners
sanders,0,were going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education
sanders,0,and i think when you give low income kids — african american white latino kids — the opportunities to get their lives together they are not going to end up in jail
sanders,0,theyre going to end up in the productive economy which is where we want them
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,white people
clinton,1,look i am deeply concerned about whats happening in every community in america and that includes white communities where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism addiction earlier deaths
clinton,1,people with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived
clinton,1,this is a remarkable and horrifying fact
clinton,1,and thats why ive come forward with for example a plan to revitalize coal country the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy by the reduction in the use of coal
clinton,1,you know coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering has our country forgotten us
clinton,1,do people not care about all of our sacrifice
clinton,1,and im going to do everything i can to address distressed communities whether they are communities of color whether they are white communities whether they are in any part of our country
clinton,1,i particularly appreciate the proposal that congressman jim clyburn has — the 10 20 30 proposal — to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty
clinton,1,and you know what
clinton,1,if you look at the numbers there are actually as many if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out
clinton,1,so yes i do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white americans — particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have — you know no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities because we have to focus where the real hurt is
clinton,1,and thats why as president i will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,yeah you can because african americans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages and high unemployment and poor educational opportunities but they face other problems as well
sanders,0,so yes we can talk about it as a racial issue
sanders,0,but it is a general economic issue
sanders,0,and heres what the economic issue is
sanders,0,the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less whether you are white or black than they used to be
sanders,0,why is that
sanders,0,because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues
sanders,0,but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country throw millions of people out on the street
sanders,0,now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world
sanders,0,but you know what you can make a middle class wage you have decent health care decent benefits
sanders,0,you once had a pension
sanders,0,those jobs in many cases are now gone
sanders,0,theyre off to china
sanders,0,now you are a worker white worker black worker who had a decent job that manufacturing job is gone
sanders,0,what have you got now
sanders,0,you are working at mcdonalds
sanders,0,that is why there is massive despair all over this country
sanders,0,people have worked their entire lives
sanders,0,theyre making a half two thirds what they used to make
sanders,0,their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all
sanders,0,and thats why this study which shows that if you can believe it today for white working class people between 45 and 54 life expectancy is actually going down
sanders,0,suicide alcoholism drugs thats why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,the answer is yes
sanders,0,weve got 11 million undocumented people in this country
sanders,0,i have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported
sanders,0,i believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform something that i strongly supported
sanders,0,i believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship
sanders,0,i agree with president obama who used executive orders to protect families because the congress the house was unable or refused to act
sanders,0,and in fact i would go further
sanders,0,what would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform judy is to bring families together not divide them up
sanders,0,and let me say this also
sanders,0,somebody who is very fond of the president agrees with him most of the time i disagree with his recent deportation policies
sanders,0,and i would not support those
sanders,0,bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people if congress doesnt do the right thing we use the executive orders of the president
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i strongly support the presidents executive actions
clinton,1,i hope the supreme court upholds them
clinton,1,i think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did
clinton,1,i am against the raids
clinton,1,im against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families waking them up in the middle of the night rounding them up
clinton,1,we should be deporting criminals not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country
clinton,1,im a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform
clinton,1,have been ever since i was in the senate
clinton,1,i was one of the original sponsors of the dream act
clinton,1,i voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007
clinton,1,senator sanders voted against it at that time
clinton,1,because i think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship
clinton,1,and as president i would expand enormous energy literally call every member of congress that i thought i could persuade
clinton,1,hopefully after the 2016 election some of the republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country
clinton,1,and they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,secretary clinton i do have a disagreement here
sanders,0,if my memory is correct i think when we saw children coming from these horrendous horrendously violent areas of honduras and neighboring countries people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence i thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country
sanders,0,that was not as i understand it the secretarys position
sanders,0,in terms of 2007 immigration reform yeah i did vote against it
sanders,0,i voted against it because the southern poverty law center among other groups said that the guest worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery
sanders,0,akin to slavery where people came into this country to do guest work were abused were exploited and if they stood up for their rights theyd be thrown out of this country
sanders,0,so it wasnt just me who opposed it
sanders,0,it was lulac one of the large latino organizations in this country
sanders,0,it was the afl cio
sanders,0,it was some of the most progressive members of the united states congress who opposed it for that reason
sanders,0,but we are where we are right now
sanders,0,and where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up
sanders,0,what we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people
clinton,1,two quick responses
clinton,1,one with respect to the central american children i made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately but we also had to send a message to families and communities in central america not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers
clinton,1,ive also called for the end of family detention for the end of privately run detention centers along with private prisons which i think are really against the common good and the rule of law
clinton,1,and with respect to the 2007 bill this was ted kennedys bill
clinton,1,and i think ted kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done
clinton,1,and i was proud to stand with him and support it
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well let me just respond
sanders,0,i worked with ted kennedy
sanders,0,he was the chairman of my committee
sanders,0,and i loved ted kennedy
sanders,0,but on this issue when you have one of the large latino organizations in america saying vote no and you have the afl cio saying vote no and you have leading progressive democrats in fact voting no i dont apologize for that vote
sanders,0,but in terms of the children i dont know to whom youre sending a message
sanders,0,who are you sending a message to
sanders,0,these are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake
sanders,0,that was the fact
sanders,0,i dont think we use them to send a message
sanders,0,i think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well that just wasnt — that just wasnt the fact senator
clinton,1,the fact is that there was a great effort made by the obama administration and others to really send a clear message because we knew that so many of these children were being abused being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border
clinton,1,so we have a disagreement on this
clinton,1,i think now what ive called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,ok you know you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has but by how you treat we treat the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation
sanders,0,and by those standards were not doing particularly well
sanders,0,we have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on earth
sanders,0,and in terms of seniors there are millions of seniors — and ive talked to them in my state of vermont and all over this country — who are trying to get by on $11000 $12000 $13000 a year social security
sanders,0,and you know what
sanders,0,you do the arithmetic
sanders,0,you cant get by on $11000 $12000 $13000 a year
sanders,0,and heres an area where secretary clinton and i believe we have a difference
sanders,0,i have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the social security trust fund starting at $250000
sanders,0,applause and when we — and when we do that we dont do what the republicans want which is to cut social security
sanders,0,we do what the american people want to expand social security by $1300 a year for people under $16000 and we extend the life of social security for 58 years
sanders,0,yes the wealthiest people the top 15 percent will pay more in taxes
sanders,0,but a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half where they dont have decent nutrition where they cant heat their homes in the wintertime
sanders,0,that is not what america should be about
sanders,0,if elected president i will do everything i can to expand social security benefits not just for seniors but for disabled veterans as well
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i think — i think its fair to say we dont have a disagreement
clinton,1,we both believe there has to be more money going into the social security system
clinton,1,ive said im looking at a couple of different ways one which you mentioned senator but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the social security trust fund
clinton,1,i have a slightly different approach though about what we should do with that initially
clinton,1,first rather than expand benefits for everyone i do want to take care of low income seniors who worked at low wage jobs
clinton,1,i want to take care of women
clinton,1,when the social security program was started in the 1930s not very many women worked
clinton,1,and women have been disadvantaged ever since
clinton,1,they do not get any credit for their care taking responsibilities
clinton,1,and the people who are often the most hard hit are widows because when their spouse dies they can lose up to one half of their social security monthly payment
clinton,1,so we have no disagreement about the need to buttress social security get more revenue into the program
clinton,1,but i want to start by helping those people who are most at risk the ones who yes are cutting their pills in half who dont believe they can make the rent who are worried about what comes next for them
sanders,0,in all due respectapplausein all due respect secretary clinton a lot of the progressive groups the online groups have really asked you a simple question
sanders,0,are you coming onboard a proposal
sanders,0,and what is that proposal
sanders,0,now the proposal that i have outlined you know should be familiar to you because it is what essentially barack obama campaigned on in 2008
sanders,0,you opposed him then
sanders,0,i would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do
sanders,0,were asking the top 15 percent including passive income to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity
sanders,0,i hope you will make a decision soon on this
clinton,1,well senator look i think were in vigorous agreement here
clinton,1,we both want to get more revenue in
clinton,1,i have yet to see a proposal that youre describing that the — raising the cap would apply to passive income
clinton,1,that has not been
sanders,0,thats my bill
sanders,0,check it out
clinton,1,well that has not been a part of most of the proposals that ive seen
clinton,1,im interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it
clinton,1,so im going to come up with the best way forward
clinton,1,were going to end up in the same place
clinton,1,were going to get more revenue
clinton,1,im going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i cant speak for the koch brothers youre referring to a super pac that we dont coordinate with that was set up to support president obama that has now decided that they want to support me
clinton,1,they are the ones who should respond to any questions
clinton,1,lets talk about our campaigns
clinton,1,im very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions
clinton,1,so im proud of senator sanders and his supporters
clinton,1,i think its great that senator sanders president obama and i have more donors than any three people who have every run certainly on the democratic side
clinton,1,thats the way it should be and im going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me to encourage them and help me do more just as senator sanders is
clinton,1,i think that is the real key here
clinton,1,we both have a lot of small donors
clinton,1,i think that sets us apart from a lot of whats happening right now on the republican side
clinton,1,the koch brothers have a very clear political agenda
clinton,1,it is an agenda in my view that would do great harm to our country
clinton,1,were going to fight it as hard as we can and were going to fight whoever the republicans nominate who will depend on the koch brothers and others
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,what we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system thats what were talking about
sanders,0,we have to be honest about it
sanders,0,it is undermining american democracy
sanders,0,when extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to super pacs and in many cases in this campaign super pacs have raised more money than individual candidates have ok
sanders,0,we had a decision to make early on do we do a super pac
sanders,0,and we said no
sanders,0,we dont represent wall street we dont represent the billionaire class so it ends up im the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no super pac
sanders,0,but what we did is we said to the working families of this country look we know things are tough but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics send us something
sanders,0,and it turns out that up until — and this has blown me away never in a million years would i have believed that i would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people
sanders,0,now secretary clintons super pac as i understand it received $25 million dollars last reporting period $15 million dollars from wall street
sanders,0,our average contribution is $27 dollars im very proud of that
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,we are mixing apples and oranges
clinton,1,my 750000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations
clinton,1,im very proud
clinton,1,that i think between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country
clinton,1,but the real issue i think that the senator is injecting into this is that if you had a super pac like president obama has which now says it wants to support me
clinton,1,its not my pac
clinton,1,if you take donations from wall street you cant be independent
clinton,1,i would just say i debated then senator obama numerous times on stages like this and he was the recipient of the largest number of wall street donations of anybody running on the democratic side ever
clinton,1,now when it mattered he stood up and took on wall street
clinton,1,he pushed through and he passed the dodd frank regulation the toughest regulations since the 1930s
clinton,1,so lets not in anyway imply here that either president obama or myself would in anyway not take on any vested interested whether its wall street or drug companies or insurance companies or frankly the gun lobby to stand up to do whats best for the american people
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,the people arent dumb
sanders,0,why in gods name does wall street applause but lets not — but lets not — lets not insult — lets not insult the intelligence of the american people
sanders,0,people arent dumb
sanders,0,why in gods name does wall street make huge campaign contributions
sanders,0,i guess just for the fun of it they want to throw money around
sanders,0,laughter why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions
sanders,0,any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs
sanders,0,why does the fossil fuel industry pay — spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions
sanders,0,any connection to the fact that not one republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system
sanders,0,applause and when we talk about wall street lets talk about wall street
sanders,0,i voted for dodd frank got an important amendment in it
sanders,0,in my view it doesnt go anywhere near far enough
sanders,0,but when we talk about wall street you have wall street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash
sanders,0,no wall street executive has been prosecuted
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well lets just — lets just follow up on this because you know ive made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail no executive too powerful to jail and because of dodd frank we now have in law a process that the president the federal reserve and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk
clinton,1,i think thats a major accomplishment
clinton,1,i agree however it doesnt go far enough because what it focuses on are the big banks which senator sanders has talked about a lot for good reason
clinton,1,i go further in the plan that ive proposed which has been called the toughest most effective comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face
clinton,1,it was an investment bank lehman brothers that contributed to our collapse
clinton,1,it was a big insurance company aig
clinton,1,it was countrywide mortgage
clinton,1,my plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be
clinton,1,and i believe that not only barney frank paul krugman and others have said that what i have proposed is the most effective
clinton,1,it goes in the right direction
clinton,1,we have dodd frank
clinton,1,we can use it to break up the banks if thats appropriate
clinton,1,but lets not kid ourselves
clinton,1,as we speak there are new problems on the horizon
clinton,1,i want to get ahead of those and thats why ive proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of thesecrosstalkapplause
sanders,0,let me you know again respectfully disagree with secretary clinton here
sanders,0,when you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the gdp of america while issuing two thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages look i think if teddy roosevelt were alive today that great trust buster would have said break them up
sanders,0,i think he would have been right
sanders,0,i think he would have said bring back a 21st century glass steagall legislation
sanders,0,i think that would have been right as well
sanders,0,thats my view
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,hey im in the united states senate and anyone who doesnt think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very very mistaken
sanders,0,i believe in government but i believe in efficient government not wasteful government
clinton,1,absolutely
clinton,1,and you know there are a number of programs that i think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve
clinton,1,there are a lot of training programs and education programs that i think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful in public schools community colleges and colleges and universities
clinton,1,i would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that were taking a hard look about what we have you know and what we dont need anymore
clinton,1,and thats what i intend to do
sanders,0,if i could just answer that we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the department of defense which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited
sanders,0,and i have the feeling youre going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,look i think we are readier than we used to be but its a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be
clinton,1,we have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9 11 and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks yet we see the terrible attack in san bernardino and know that we havent done enough
clinton,1,so we have to go after this both abroad and at home
clinton,1,we have to go after terrorist networks predominantly isis — thats not the only one but lets focus on that for a minute
clinton,1,we have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from isis
clinton,1,that is principally an american led air campaign that we are now engaged in
clinton,1,we have to support the fighters on the ground principally the arabs and the kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from raqqa to ramadi
clinton,1,we have to continue to work with the iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside iraq like mosul when they are able to do so
clinton,1,and we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters
clinton,1,and we have to take on isis online
clinton,1,they are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda a celebrator of violence an instigator of attacks using their online presence
clinton,1,here at home weve got to do a better job coordinating between federal state and local law enforcement
clinton,1,we need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources but from sources overseas that can be a real time fusion effort to get information where its needed
clinton,1,but the final thing i want to say about this is the following
clinton,1,you know after 9 11 one of the efforts that we did in new york was if you see something or hear something suspicious report it
clinton,1,and we need to do that throughout the country
clinton,1,but we need to understand that american muslims are on the front line of our defense
clinton,1,they are more likely to know whats happening in their families and their communities and they need to feel not just invited but welcomed within the american society
clinton,1,so when somebody like donald trump and othersapplausestirs up the demagoguery against american muslims that hurts us at home
clinton,1,its not only offensive its dangerous
clinton,1,and the same goes for overseas where we have to put together a coalition of muslim nations
clinton,1,i know how to do that
clinton,1,i put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program
clinton,1,applause and you dont go tell muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the united states who insults their religion
clinton,1,so this has to be looked at overall and we have to go at it from every possible angle
sanders,0,let me — let me just say this
sanders,0,what a president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major i think responsibility is to a make certain that we keep our people safe that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity
sanders,0,i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didnt believe them
sanders,0,and if you go to my web siteberniesanderscom what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house in fact did happen in terms of the instability that occurred
sanders,0,now i think an area in kind of a vague way or not so vague where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change
sanders,0,look the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states certainly working with our allies we can overthrow dictators all over the world
sanders,0,and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator
sanders,0,we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to
sanders,0,we got rid of gadhafi
sanders,0,but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator its to understand what happens the day after
sanders,0,and in libya for example the united states secretary clinton as secretary of state working with some other countries did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi
sanders,0,but what happened is a political vacuum developed
sanders,0,isis came in and now occupies significant territory in libya and is now prepared unless we stop them to have a terrorist foothold
sanders,0,but this is nothing new
sanders,0,this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments
sanders,0,mossadegh back in 1953
sanders,0,nobody knows who mossadegh was democratically elected prime minister of iran
sanders,0,he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british
sanders,0,and as a result of that the shah of iran came in terrible dictator
sanders,0,the result of that you had the iranian revolution coming in and that is where we are today
sanders,0,unintended consequences
sanders,0,so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences
sanders,0,i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,if i could just respond
clinton,1,two points
clinton,1,one senator sanders voted in 1998 on what i think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to iraq calling for the end of saddam husseins regime
clinton,1,he voted in favor of regime change with libya voted in favor of the security council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do which of course we followed through on
clinton,1,i do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat isis in 2016
clinton,1,its very important we focus on the threats we face today and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in
clinton,1,when people go to vote in primaries or caucuses they are voting not only for the president they are voting for the commander in chief
clinton,1,and its important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are and who is best prepared for dealing with them
clinton,1,as we all remember senator obama when he ran against me was against the war in iraq
clinton,1,and yet when he won he turned to me trusting my judgment my experience to become secretary of state
clinton,1,i was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,judy if i can there is no question secretary clinton and i are friends and i have a lot of respect for her that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs
sanders,0,secretary of state for four years
sanders,0,youve got a bit of experience i would imagine
sanders,0,but judgment matters as well
sanders,0,judgment matters as well
sanders,0,and she and i looked at the same evidence coming from the bush administration regarding iraq
sanders,0,i lead the opposition against it
sanders,0,she voted for it
sanders,0,but more importantly in terms of this libya resolution that you have noted before this was a virtually unanimous consent
sanders,0,everybody voted for it wanting to see libya move toward democracy of course we all wanted to do that
sanders,0,that is very different than talking about specific action for regime change which i did not support
clinton,1,you did support a un security council approach which we did follow up on
clinton,1,and look i think its important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the obama administration was and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin laden
clinton,1,i looked at the evidence
clinton,1,i looked at the intelligence
clinton,1,i got the briefings
clinton,1,i recommended that the president go forward
clinton,1,it was a hard choice
clinton,1,not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that
clinton,1,and at the end of the day it was the presidents decision
clinton,1,so he had to leave the situation room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision
clinton,1,im proud that i gave him that advice
clinton,1,and im very grateful to the brave navy seals who carried out that mission
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,judy one area very briefly
sanders,0,where the secretary and i have a very profound difference in the last debate — and i believe in her book — very good book by the way — in her book and in this last debate she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of henry kissinger
sanders,0,now i find it rather amazing because i happen to believe that henry kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country
sanders,0,applause i am proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend
sanders,0,i will not take advice from henry kissinger
sanders,0,and in fact kissingers actions in cambodia when the united states bombed that country overthrew prince sihanouk created the instability for pol pot and the khmer rouge to come in who then butchered some 3 million innocent people one of the worst genocides in the history of the world
sanders,0,so count me in as somebody who will not be listening to henry kissinger
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy and we have yet to know who that is
sanders,0,well it aint henry kissinger
sanders,0,thats for sure
clinton,1,thats fine
clinton,1,thats fine
clinton,1,laughter you know i listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas
clinton,1,i think it is fair to say whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are that with respect to china one of the most challenging relationships we have his opening up china and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of china is an incredibly useful relationship for the united states of america
clinton,1,applause so if we want to pick and choose — and i certainly do — people i listen to people i dont listen to people i listen to for certain areas then i think we have to be fair and look at the entire world because its a big complicated world out there
sanders,0,it is
clinton,1,and yes people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the united states
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,i find — i mean its just a very different you know historical perspective here
sanders,0,kissinger was one of those people during the vietnam era who talked about the domino theory
sanders,0,not everybody remembers that
sanders,0,you do
sanders,0,i do
sanders,0,the domino theory you know if vietnam goes china da da da da da da da
sanders,0,thats what he talked about the great threat of china
sanders,0,and then after the war this is the guy who in fact yes youre right he opened up relations with china and now pushed various type of trade agreements resulting in american workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to china
sanders,0,the terrible authoritarian communist dictatorship he warned us about now hes urging companies to shut down and move to china
sanders,0,not my kind of guy
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well this is what i would say
sanders,0,it is a complicated relationship
sanders,0,i congratulate secretary of state john kerry and the president for working on this agreement
sanders,0,as youve indicated what is happening in syria the number of people the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed — men women 20000 children the people who are forced to flee their own country — their own country — it is unspeakable
sanders,0,it is a real horror
sanders,0,now what i think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with russia
sanders,0,but lets be clear russias aggressive actions in the crimea and in ukraine have brought about a situation where president obama and nato — correctly i believe — are saying you know what were going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched that he is not going to get away with aggressive action
sanders,0,i happen to believe that putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and hes trying to rally his people in support of him
sanders,0,but bottom line is the president is right
sanders,0,we have to put more money
sanders,0,we have to work with nato to protect eastern europe against any kind of russian aggression
clinton,1,well with respect to syria i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made
clinton,1,the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria
clinton,1,the agreement on a cease fire though is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to
clinton,1,you know the russians wanted to buy time
clinton,1,are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate whats left of the opposition which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease fire
clinton,1,so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease fire up as quickly as possible
clinton,1,but i would add this
clinton,1,you know the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution
clinton,1,at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva which set forth a cease fire and moving toward a political resolution trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together
clinton,1,this is incredibly complicated because weve got iran as a big player in addition to russia
clinton,1,we have saudi arabia turkey and others who have very important interests in their view
clinton,1,this is one of the areas ive disagreed with senator sanders on who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria which i think would be a grave mistake
clinton,1,putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me
clinton,1,trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together as he has suggested in the past is equally a nonstarter
clinton,1,so lets support what secretary kerry and the president are doing but lets hope that we can accelerate the cease fire because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing try to do everything they can to destroy whats left of the opposition
clinton,1,and remember the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups
clinton,1,so as we get a cease fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria turkey lebanon jordan and the like
clinton,1,so weve got some real work to do and lets try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me just — just say this
sanders,0,for a start the secretary and i disagree — and i think the president does not agree with her — in terms of the concept of a no fly zone in syria
sanders,0,i think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there as i mentioned a moment ago
sanders,0,i applaud secretary kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement
sanders,0,lets hope that it holds
sanders,0,but furthermore what we have got to do im sorry yes i do believe that we have got to do everything that we can and it will not happen tomorrow
sanders,0,but i do hope that in years to come just as occurred with cuba 10 20 years ago people would say reach normalized relations with cuba
sanders,0,and by the way i hope we can end the trade embargo with cuba as well
sanders,0,but the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with iran maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world yes that is something i want to achieve
sanders,0,and i believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive to be principled but to have the goal of trying to improve relations
sanders,0,thats how you make peace in the world
sanders,0,you sit down and you work with people you make demands of people in this case demanding iran stop the support of international terrorism
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i respectfully disagree
clinton,1,i think we have achieved a great deal with the iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the iranian nuclear weapons program
clinton,1,that has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement
clinton,1,i do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with iran
clinton,1,yes they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism
clinton,1,yes they have to stop trying to destabilize the middle east causing even more chaos
clinton,1,yes theyve got to get out of syria
clinton,1,theyve got to quit sponsoring hezbollah and hamas
clinton,1,they have got to quit trying to ship rockets into gaza that can be used against israel
clinton,1,we have a lot of work to do with iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,we have a lot of work to do
sanders,0,we have a lot of work to do
sanders,0,but i recall when secretary clinton ran against then senator obama she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to iran that you want to talk to our enemies
sanders,0,i have no illusion
sanders,0,of course you are right
sanders,0,iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world destabilizing areas
sanders,0,everybody knows that
sanders,0,but our goal is in fact to try over a period of time to in fact deal with our enemies not just ignore that reality
sanders,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,
clinton,1,senator sanders from a debate in 2008 quote what i said
clinton,1,the question was would you meet with an adversary without conditions
clinton,1,i said no
clinton,1,and in fact in obama administration we did not meet with anybody without conditions
clinton,1,that is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,no i think the idea was that president — then senator obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents
sanders,0,its easier to talk to your friends
sanders,0,its harder to talk to your enemies
sanders,0,i think we should do both
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i was pleased that nato announced just this week that theyre going to start doing patrols in the mediterranean in the aegean to try to interdict the smugglers to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the european union
clinton,1,and its especially significant that they are working with both turkey and greece in order to do this
clinton,1,with respect to the united states i think our role in nato our support for the eu as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country we should be doing our part
clinton,1,and we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to turkey and to members of the eu
clinton,1,in particular
clinton,1,this is a humanitarian catastrophe
clinton,1,there is no other description of it
clinton,1,so we do as the united states have to support our friends our allies in europe
clinton,1,we have to stand with them
clinton,1,we have to provide financial support to them
clinton,1,we have to provide the nato support to back up the mission that is going on
clinton,1,and we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves
sanders,0,a couple of years ago i had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation
sanders,0,and i went to one of these turkish refugee camps right on the border of syria
sanders,0,and what a sad sight that was men women children forced out of their homes
sanders,0,and turkey by the way did a very decent thing providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people
sanders,0,it seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed for the downtrodden that i very strongly disagree with those republican candidates who say you know what weve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing nothing at all
sanders,0,that is not what america is supposed to be about
sanders,0,so i believe that working with europe — and by the way you know weve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world
sanders,0,you got kuwait and you got qatar and you got saudi arabia
sanders,0,they have a responsibility as well
sanders,0,but i think this is a worldwide — that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis were seeing from syria and afghanistan as well
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,you know franklin delano roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the american people were unemployed country was in incredible despair
sanders,0,and he stood before the american people and he said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself a profound statement that gave the american people the courage to believe that yes we could get out of that terrible depression
sanders,0,and then what he did is redefine the role of government
sanders,0,you know you had herbert hoover before that saying no we got to only worry about the deficit
sanders,0,so what if mass unemployment exists
sanders,0,so what if children are going hungry
sanders,0,thats not the role of the government
sanders,0,and when fdr said yeah it is that were going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs to build homes to feed people to protect the farmers we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish
sanders,0,and kind of — thats what i see our campaign is about right now
sanders,0,in this particular moment of serious crises saying to the american people dont give up on the political process
sanders,0,dont listen to the trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us
sanders,0,if we reengage and get involved yeah we can have health care for all people we can make public colleges and universities tuition free
sanders,0,we do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality
sanders,0,in the same light as the foreign leader winston churchills politics were not my politics
sanders,0,he was kind of a conservative guy in many respects
sanders,0,but nobody can deny that as a wartime leader he rallied the british people when they stood virtually alone against the nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory
sanders,0,those are two leaders that i admire very much
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,i certainly agree with fdr for all the reasons senator sanders said
clinton,1,and i agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world
clinton,1,i would choose nelson mandela for his generosity of heart his understanding of the need for reconciliation
clinton,1,but i want to — i want to follow up on something having to do with leadership because you know today senator sanders said that president obama failed the presidential leadership test
clinton,1,and this is not the first time that he has criticized president obama
clinton,1,in the past he has called him weak
clinton,1,he has called him a disappointment
clinton,1,he wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers remorse when it comes to president obamas leadership and legacy
clinton,1,and i just couldnt agree — disagree more with those kinds of comments
clinton,1,you know from my perspective maybe because i understand what president obama inherited not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the republicans in congress i dont think he gets the credit he deserves for being a presidentapplausewho got us out of thatapplauseput us on firm ground and has sent us into the future
clinton,1,and it is a — the kind of criticism that weve heard from senator sanders about our president i expect from republicans
clinton,1,i do not expect from someone running for the democratic nomination to succeed president obama
sanders,0,that isapplausemadam secretary that is a low blow
sanders,0,i have worked with president obama for the last seven years
sanders,0,when president obama came into office we were losing 800000 jobs a month 800000 jobs a month
sanders,0,we had a $14 trillion deficit
sanders,0,and the worlds financial system is on the verge of collapse
sanders,0,as a result of his efforts and the efforts of joe biden against unprecedented i was there in the senate unprecedented republican obstructionism we have made enormous progress
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,but you know what
sanders,0,last i heard we lived in a democratic society
sanders,0,last i heard a united states senator had the right to disagree with the president including a president who has done such an extraordinary job
sanders,0,so i have voiced criticisms
sanders,0,youre right
sanders,0,maybe you havent
sanders,0,i have
sanders,0,but i think to suggest that i have voiced criticism this blurb that you talk about you know what the blurb said
sanders,0,the blurb said that the next president of the united states has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process
sanders,0,thats what i said
sanders,0,that is what i believe
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,president obama and i are friends
sanders,0,as you know he came to vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator
sanders,0,i have worked for his re election
sanders,0,his first election and his re election
sanders,0,but i think it is really unfair to suggest that i have not been supportive of the president
sanders,0,i have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue
sanders,0,do senators have the right to disagree with the president
sanders,0,have you ever disagreed with a president
sanders,0,i suspect you may have
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know senator what i am concerned about is not disagreement on issues saying that this is what i would rather do i dont agree with the president on that calling the president weak calling him a disappointment calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re election in 2012 you know i think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements
clinton,1,as a senator yes i was a senator
clinton,1,i understand we can disagree on the path forward
clinton,1,but those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that i find particularly troubling
sanders,0,well one of us ran against barack obama
sanders,0,i was not that candidate
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,all right look this has been a great debate
sanders,0,a lot of interesting issues have come together
sanders,0,let me conclude by just saying this
sanders,0,there is no president in my view not hillary clinton not bernie sanders who has the capability or the power to take on wall street large campaign donors the corporate media the big money interests in this country alone
sanders,0,this campaign is not just about electing a president
sanders,0,what this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of americans working people who have given up on the political process they dont think anybody hears their pains or their concerns
sanders,0,young people for whom getting involved in politics is as you know its like going to the moon
sanders,0,it aint going to happen
sanders,0,low income people who are not involved in the political process
sanders,0,what this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent who today have so much economic and political power
sanders,0,thank you all very much
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know we — we agree that weve got to get unaccountable money out of politics
clinton,1,we agree that wall street should never be allowed to wreck main street again
clinton,1,but heres the point i want to make tonight
clinton,1,i am not a single issue candidate and i do not believe we live in a single issue country
clinton,1,i think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back whether its poison in the water of the children of flint or whether its the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country or whether it is any other american today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism by sexism by discrimination against the lgbt community against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers thats what i want to take on
clinton,1,and here in wisconsin i want to reiterate weve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it beforeapplausethe american middle class and who are being attacked by ideologues by demagogues
clinton,1,yes does wall street and big financial interests along with drug companies insurance companies big oil all of it have too much influence
clinton,1,youre right
clinton,1,but if we were to stop that tomorrow we would still have the indifference the negligence that we saw in flint
clinton,1,we would still have racism holding people back
clinton,1,we would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay
clinton,1,we would still have lgbt people who get married on saturday and get fired on monday
clinton,1,and we would still have governors like scott walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions
clinton,1,so im going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of americans fulfilling their potential because i dont think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single american to live up to theirs
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,anderson thank you very much
sanders,0,over the last several weeks i had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of flint at a town meeting in flint and i have to tell you what i heard and what i saw literally shattered me
sanders,0,and it was beyond belief that children in flint michigan in the united states of america in the year 2016 are being poisoned
sanders,0,that is clearly not what this country should be about
sanders,0,as anderson indicated theres a lot of blame to go around and one of the points that i have made is that i believe the governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible
sanders,0,he should resign
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,but more importantly what is happening in flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country
sanders,0,in recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires and increase in income and wealth inequality and all over this country middle class families are struggling
sanders,0,cities and towns are struggling in order to provide basic services
sanders,0,among many other things we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our water systems our waste water plants our roads and our bridges
sanders,0,the wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right take care of the people no more tax breaks for billionaires
clinton,1,well ill start by saying amen to that
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,we are here in flint im very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city
clinton,1,i agree the governor should resign or be recalledapplause support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that
clinton,1,but that is not enough
clinton,1,we have to focus on what must be done to help the people of flint
clinton,1,i support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure
clinton,1,the state should also be sending money immediately to help this city
clinton,1,applause and cheering
clinton,1,i know the state of michigan has a rainy day fund for emergencies what is more important than the health and wellbeing of the people particularly children
clinton,1,it is raining lead in flint and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and well get to what we need to do to help the children and the people when i have a little more time because thats just as important as fixing the pipes
clinton,1,well nikki its a very fair question
clinton,1,your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of flint down
clinton,1,so i think that there are there several things
clinton,1,all the repair work that is being done — and mayor weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water
clinton,1,everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it
clinton,1,you do everything with it
clinton,1,every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through
clinton,1,so i will make sure as president that i double and triple check
clinton,1,i will work with elected officials who i trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of congress so that we can assure you that when its fixed you can trust it
clinton,1,you deserve nothing less
clinton,1,well i support what president obama is doing
clinton,1,he called for and got accountability from the officials at the epa to make sure the state is doing its job
clinton,1,he expanded medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need
clinton,1,he is also ordered that there be a head start program
clinton,1,i support that
clinton,1,when it comes to the water itself we are supporting a program that mayor waver announced through flint waterworks to pay people in flint not outsiders but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes
clinton,1,i would do even more of that
clinton,1,as president what we were able to put together was a beginning
clinton,1,as president i would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education interventions that children need
sanders,0,what is going is a disgrace beyond belief
sanders,0,as the president of the united states this is what i would do is if local government does not have the resources — if state government for whatever reason america shouldnt be poisoned federal government comes in federal government acts
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,what is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in flint
sanders,0,you are paying three times more for poison water than i am paying in burlington vermont for clean water
sanders,0,first thing is you say people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,second of all to ease anxiety cdc has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have
sanders,0,thirdly the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure our water systems
sanders,0,i have a bill for a trillion dollars it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint michigan and communities all over the country
sanders,0,thats a good point anderson
sanders,0,listen i suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to china or mexico
sanders,0,we could trust them im sure
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,or maybe — you know maybe anderson tell you what — we should — maybe we should let wall street come in and run the city of flintapplausebecause we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the american people
sanders,0,look we live in a democracy and im not in the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects
sanders,0,but at the end of the day i will trust the people to create a government that works for them rather than wall street or corporate america
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i think that the people here in the region who knew about this and failed to follow what you just said rightly the law required have been eliminated from the epa
clinton,1,i dont — well i dont know how high it goes
clinton,1,i would certainly be launching an investigation
clinton,1,i think there is one
clinton,1,i was told that — you know some of the higher ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening
clinton,1,so i would have a full investigation determine who knew what when
clinton,1,and yes people should be fired
clinton,1,how far up it went i dont know
clinton,1,but as far as it goes they should be relieved because they failed this city
clinton,1,but let me just add this anderson
clinton,1,this is not the only place where this kind of action is needed
clinton,1,we have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water including lead are way above what anybody should tolerate
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,we have a higher rate of tested lead in people in cleveland than in flint
clinton,1,so im not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for flint
clinton,1,i want to tackle this problem across the board
clinton,1,and if people know about it and theyre not acting and theyre in the government at any level they should be forced to resign
sanders,0,president sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and president sanders would make the point that how does it happen in the wealthiest country in the history of the world
sanders,0,what are our priorities when among others republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people
sanders,0,how did we have so much money available to go to war in iraq and spend trillions of dollarsapplausebut somehow not have enough money — not just for flint the secretary is right
sanders,0,there are communities all over this country — its not just infrastructure it is education
sanders,0,detroits public school system is collapsing
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,anderson the bottom line is and what my campaign is is changing our national priorities
sanders,0,we need a government that works for all of us
sanders,0, not just wealthy campaign contributors
sanders,0,i will make a personal promise to you that the epa and the epa director that i appoint will make sure that every water system in the united states of america is tested and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking
clinton,1,well i agree completely
clinton,1,i want to go further though
clinton,1,i want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because its not only in water systems its also in soil and its in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes
clinton,1,thats why 500000 children today have lead — lead in their bodies
clinton,1,so i want to do exactly what you said
clinton,1,we will commit to a priority to change the water systems and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere
clinton,1,we were making progress on this in the 1990s
clinton,1,i worked with then senator obama to get more money more support to do more to remove lead
clinton,1,that has unfortunately been in many ways moved to a lower priority
clinton,1,i will elevate it and i will do everything i can
clinton,1,water soil and paint
clinton,1, were going to get rid of it
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well thats going to be up to the legal system don
clinton,1,i mean i cant standing here — i dont have all the facts but people should be held accountable wherever that leads
clinton,1,if it leads to resignation or recall if youre in political office
clinton,1,if it leads to civil penalties if it leads to criminal responsibility
clinton,1,there has to be an absolute accountability and i will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are
sanders,0,well i agree you know
sanders,0,we cant sit up here — i cant sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act
sanders,0,but i will tell you this that after an investigation if people in fact were found to have committed a criminal act — i talked to a mother
sanders,0,imagine this for a second imagine a mother who had a bright seven year old gregarious girl doing well in school
sanders,0,two years later that child is now in special education intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated
sanders,0,that is a crime against that child and the people of flint
sanders,0,and clearly people are going to have to be held accountable
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i think because throughout my public career i have been evening the odds for people in every way that i could
clinton,1,i started out with the childrens defense fund i worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person an activist
clinton,1,certainly in arkansas then in the white house to try to fix problems wherever i saw them
clinton,1,and this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time
clinton,1,so when i heard about it i immediately sent people here to find out what was going on
clinton,1,it was almost unbelievable
clinton,1,we have this problem in other places but we dont say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority as this one was
clinton,1,then when i talked to the mayor i basically said what can i do to help
clinton,1,then when i came here and i met with some of the mothers and met their children and heard their stories — im just determined to do whatever i can
clinton,1,so i have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because youve got to get the federal money youve got to get the state money but im going to do everything i can
clinton,1,and i will be with flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity i am
clinton,1,and if im president it will always be a priority for action from me
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well first of all thats not quite accurate
sanders,0,i was here long before that
sanders,0,i will you what i did
sanders,0,what i did was meet very quietly in detroit with parents and others who were impacted by this disaster
sanders,0,and the second thing i did is hold a town meeting which was as nonpolitical as i could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in flint
sanders,0,i think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of flint is that a certain point the tv cameras and cnn will disappear
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community
sanders,0,all i can say is if you check my record going back a long time i have stood with those who are hurting
sanders,0,i have stood with those who have no money and i have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the united states of america
sanders,0,thats my record and im proud of it
clinton,1,im going to do what i think will work which is both carrots and sticks
clinton,1,let me talk about the carrots
clinton,1,were going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in america
clinton,1,i have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that i will be implementing
clinton,1,were also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said its woefully under resourced
clinton,1,that will put a lot of people to work
clinton,1,i want to do more to help small businesses they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow particularly minority and women owned small businesses
clinton,1,we need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but i am also going to go after companies
clinton,1,you know when a company decides to leave like nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from chicago and illinois to stay there i will claw back the benefits
clinton,1,they will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them
clinton,1,i am also going to go after companies like johnson controls in wisconsin
clinton,1,they came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to europe
clinton,1,they are going to have to pay an exit fee
clinton,1,we are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country
sanders,0,i am very glad anderson that secretary clinton discovered religion on this issue but its a little bit too late
sanders,0,secretary clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate america
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,nafta supported by the secretary cost us 800000 jobs nationwide tens of thousands of jobs in the midwest
sanders,0,permanent normal trade relations with china cost us millions of jobs
sanders,0,look i was on a picket line in early 1990s against nfata because you didnt need a phd in economics to understand that american workers should not be forced to compete against people in mexico making 25 cents an hour
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and the reason that i was one of the first not one of the last to be in opposition to the tpp is that american workersapplauseshould not be forced to compete against people in vietnam today making a minimum wage of $065 an hour
sanders,0,look what we have got to do is tell corporate america that they cannot continue to shut down
sanders,0,weve lost 60000 factories since 2001
sanders,0,theyre going to start having to if im president invest in this country — not in china not in mexico
clinton,1,well — well ill tell you something else that senator sanders was against
clinton,1,he was against the auto bailout
clinton,1,in january of 2009 president elect obama asked everybody in the congress to vote for the bailout
clinton,1,the money was there and had to be released in order to save the american auto industry and four million jobs and to begin the restructuring
clinton,1,we had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time
clinton,1,i voted to save the auto industry
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,he voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry
clinton,1,i think that is a pretty big difference
sanders,0,well i — if you are talking about the wall street bailout where some of your friends destroyed this economy
clinton,1,you know
sanders,0, through — excuse me im talking
clinton,1,if youre gonna talk tell the whole story senator sanders
sanders,0,let me tell my story
sanders,0,you tell yours
clinton,1,i will
sanders,0,your story is for — voting for every disastrous trade agreement and voting for corporate america
sanders,0,did i vote against the wall street bailout
sanders,0,when billionaires on wall street destroyed this economy they went to congress and they said please well be good boys bail us out
sanders,0,you know what i said
sanders,0,i said let the billionaires themselves bail out wall street
sanders,0,it shouldnt be the middle class of this country
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,ok so
sanders,0,wait a minute
sanders,0,wait
sanders,0,could i finish
sanders,0,youll have your turn all right
sanders,0,but ultimately if you look at our records i stood up to corporate america time and time again
sanders,0,i went to mexico
sanders,0,i saw the lives of people who were working in american factories and making $025 an hour
sanders,0,i understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country
sanders,0,i led the fight against us
sanders,0,that is one of the major differences that we have
clinton,1,well if i — if i couldapplauseto set the record straight i voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when i was in the senate
clinton,1,it was called cafta
clinton,1,i came out against the tpp after it was finished
clinton,1,i thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before i opposed it
clinton,1,i oppose it
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,now let me get back to what happened in january of 2009
clinton,1,the bush administration negotiated the deal
clinton,1,were there things in it that i didnt like
clinton,1,would i have done it differently
clinton,1,absolutely
clinton,1,but was the auto bailout money in it — the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry
clinton,1,yes it was
clinton,1,so when i talk about senator sanders being a one issue candidate i mean very clearly — you have to make hard choices when youre in positions of responsibility
clinton,1,the two senators from michigan stood on the floor and said we have to get this money released
clinton,1,i went with them and i went with barack obama
clinton,1,you did not
clinton,1,if everybody had voted the way he did i believe the auto industry would have collapsed taking four million jobs with it
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,i believe that the recklessness the greed and the illegal behavior of wall street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in the history of the united — modern history of the united states of america
sanders,0,and i will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on wall street
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and what i proposed — and i had an amendment that was defeated — it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the senate — that said to those people on the top who benefited from wall street greed — i said you pay for the bailout
sanders,0,dont go to my constituents who are struggling to make ends meet
sanders,0,in terms of the auto bailout of course that made sense
sanders,0,in terms of the stimulus package of course that made sense and i strongly supported president obamas position on that
sanders,0,but let us be clear one of the major issues secretary clinton says im a one issue person well i guess so
sanders,0,my one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class
sanders,0,thats my one issue
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well all i can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and ohio and indiana and illinois and wisconsin and missouri and other places in the midwest were facing i think it was the right decision to heed what president elect obama asked us to do
clinton,1,he sent a letter an authorized letter asking us to support that to save the auto industry
clinton,1,yes were there things in it that you and i would not have necessarily wanted
clinton,1,thats true
clinton,1,but when it came down to it you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it
clinton,1,i voted to save the auto industry
clinton,1,and i am very glad that i did
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me just say this while we are on wall street one of us has a super pac
sanders,0,one of us has raised $15 million from wall street for that super pac
sanders,0,one of us has given speeches on wall street for hundreds of thousands of dollars
sanders,0,now i kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech it must be a great speech
sanders,0,i think we should release it and let the american people see what that transcript was
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,and i have said and i will say again i will be happy to release anything i have as long as everybody else does too because what really is behind that question republicans and democrats is where i can stand up to wall street
clinton,1,well lets have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change
clinton,1,i went to wall street when i was a united states senator
clinton,1,i told them they were wrecking the economy
clinton,1,i asked for a moratorium on foreclosures
clinton,1,i asked that we do more to try to prevent what i worried was going to happen
clinton,1,i also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole
clinton,1,i also called for changes in ceo pay
clinton,1,i have a record
clinton,1,and you know what if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on wall street if you ever took money president obama took more money from wall street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had
clinton,1,and when it came time to stand up to wall street he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the great depression with the dodd frank regulations
sanders,0,all right look secretary clinton wants everybody else to release it well im your democratic opponent i release it here it is
sanders,0,there aint nothing
sanders,0,i dont give speeches to wall street for hundreds of thousands of dollars you got it
sanders,0,second of all when we talk about being tough on wall street and this galls me and the american people
sanders,0,recently goldman sachs among many other major financial institutions on wall street as you know reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages $5 billion settlement
sanders,0,you know how many people executives on wall street have gone to jail
sanders,0,if you are a kid caught with marijuana in michigan you get a police record
sanders,0,if you are an executive on wall street that destroys the american economy you pay a $5 billion fine no police record
sanders,0,if i am elected president we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i think we are in vigorous agreement on this
clinton,1,i have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail no executive too powerful to jail
clinton,1,and i have said that i would use the tools in the dodd frank regulations that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy they would be broken up
clinton,1,because we now have tools laws that we didnt have before
clinton,1,and i am very happy we did
clinton,1,because there does need to be accountability including criminal accountability if it is called for
sanders,0,well im blaming the trade policies
sanders,0,you know what
sanders,0,this is an amazing thing which i didnt know until recently and i wonder how many people did know this
sanders,0,well hillary clinton and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies
sanders,0,she wasnt alone
sanders,0,we have many many republicans and far too many democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies
sanders,0,do you knowapplause do you know that in 1960 detroit michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in america
sanders,0,flint michigan was a prosperous city but then what happened is corporate america said why do i want to pay somebody in michigan a living wage when i can pay slave wages in mexico or china
sanders,0,were going to shut down were going to move abroad were going to bring those products back into this country
sanders,0,those trade policies as much as any other set of policies has resulted in the shrinking of the american middle class
sanders,0,and ill tell you what else it did
sanders,0,its not only job loss by the millions it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing in some cases today pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago
sanders,0,how stupid is that trade policy
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know if were going to argue about the 1990s instead of talking about the future which id much prefer because i think every election is about the future and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future — but if we are going to talk about the 1990s i think its only fair to say that at the end of the 1990s after two terms of my husbands presidency the unemployment rate in michigan was 44 percent
clinton,1,there had been a net increase of 54000 manufacturing jobs
clinton,1,there had been a net increase of 653000 jobs overall
clinton,1,and one of the ways jobs were brought to and grown here in michigan was through something called the export import bank which helped a lot of businesses particularly small businesses be able to export around the world
clinton,1,senator sanders opposes that
clinton,1,i think were in a race for exports
clinton,1,i think china germany everybody else supports their businesses
clinton,1,here in michigan theres been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports primarily from small businesses
clinton,1,i favor that hes opposed it
clinton,1,i want to do everything i can for us to compete and win in the global economy
clinton,1, and thats what i will do as president
sanders,0,
sanders,0,ill tell you what i say
sanders,0,
sanders,0,ill tell you what i say
sanders,0,do you know what the other name of the export import bank is
sanders,0,what its called in washington
sanders,0,its called the bank of boeing because boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the export import bank
sanders,0,seventy five percent of the funds going from the federal government the export import bank goes to large profitable corporations
sanders,0,many of these corporations have shut down in america and have gone abroad to exploit poor people
sanders,0,you know what
sanders,0,i dont think its a great idea for the american taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the united states of america
sanders,0, seventy five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations
sanders,0,well let me tell you i dont want to break the bad news
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,democrats are not always right
sanders,0,democrats have often supported corporate welfareapplausedemocrats have supported disastrous trade agreements but on this issue i do not believe in corporate welfare and in fact secretary clinton may know or not know but as a member of the financial services committee i worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country
clinton,1,when i traveled around the world on you behalf as secretary of state and went to 112 countries one thing i saw everywhere was how european and asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world
clinton,1,in fact without the export import bank supporting businesses of all sizes — i believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported
clinton,1,instead of exporting products we would be exporting jobs
clinton,1,i just believe that senator sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results — i saw it as a senator from new york
clinton,1,your senators saw it here in michigan
clinton,1,they can give you the names of 240 companies in michigan that have been helped
clinton,1,there is a company in levonia being helped there are companies all over this state
clinton,1,i know if we are going to compete and win in the global economy we cant let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach
clinton,1,i will not agree with that
clinton,1,i will tell you what anderson after i investigated it i concluded they did and heres why
clinton,1,there two big plane manufacturers in the world theres airbus and boeing
clinton,1,airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world
clinton,1,we dont have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government
clinton,1,i did go in many places around the world to sell american products because the alternatives were usually european asian primarily chinese products
clinton,1,that to me was an unacceptable concession
clinton,1,so yes boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support
sanders,0,isnt it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year shutting down in america going to china going to mexico
sanders,0,absolutely they need a handout from the american middle class — i dont think so
sanders,0,second of all
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,second of all secretary clinton traveled the world she has been to europe
sanders,0,and lets talk about europe versus the united states
sanders,0,im sure that when you were in europe and france and germany and the uk and all of the other countries you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the uk compared to america we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the uk for health care for our people
sanders,0,we are spending 50 percent more than the french
sanders,0,when we talk about europe and their pluses and minuses one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all
clinton,1,we are on the path to doing that thanks to president obama and the affordable care act we have 90 percent coverage
clinton,1,we are lacking 10 percent
clinton,1,we are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage
clinton,1,well first of all i am looking at your daughter and im very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery
clinton,1,but it never should have happened
clinton,1,you know on average 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country
clinton,1,i think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms
clinton,1,the brady bill which has been in effect now for about 23 years has kept more than two million purchases from going forward
clinton,1,so we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile
clinton,1,but the comprehensive background checks closing the gun show loophole closing the online loophole closing whats called the charleston loophole where you get a gun at the end of three days even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in charleston did
clinton,1,and then they found out later he shouldnt have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at mother emmanuel church
clinton,1,i also believe so strongly gene that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers
clinton,1,and it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example
clinton,1,to try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldnt have
clinton,1,so that is an issue that senator sanders and i differ on i voted against giving them immunity but i think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business
clinton,1,they can be held accountable
clinton,1,and then i do think we have got to have a public
clinton,1,well weve got to have a public discussion because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time
clinton,1,and there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter
sanders,0,i remember president obama being on television maybe three months ago
sanders,0,showed the secretary members as well
sanders,0,she knows the president i know the president
sanders,0,and he is generally speaking in public and hes not a very emotional guy
sanders,0,and he — after the mass killing in oregon if my memory is correct he said look
sanders,0,there — to be honest with you lets be honest
sanders,0,nobody has a magic solution to this problem
sanders,0,any lunatic tomorrow any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific
sanders,0,and you know what
sanders,0,for us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue
sanders,0,but what the president said he said look this is a tough issue
sanders,0,but we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings
sanders,0,you are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control
sanders,0,i have a d minus voting record from the nra
sanders,0,you are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for congress because i was the only candidate who said you know what i dont think its a great idea in this country to be selling military style assault weapons which are designed to kill people
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i lost that election by three votes
sanders,0,i agree with what the secretary said
sanders,0,we need to expand and improve the instant background checks
sanders,0,bottom line is people who should not have guns in america should not be able to buy guns in america
sanders,0,absolutely i agree
sanders,0,look that bill had some sensible provisions in it
sanders,0,it had the banning of bullets that pierce policemens armor
sanders,0,is that a good thing
sanders,0,i think we would want to get rid of that
sanders,0,particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them
sanders,0,that bill had bad things in it
sanders,0,what i have said
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,that was a very arbitrary decision
sanders,0,what that real debate was about as you may or may not know was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect
sanders,0,i wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible
sanders,0,that was the most important part of that bill
sanders,0,well this is what i say if i understand it — and correct me if im wrong
sanders,0,if you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun and then three days later if you go out and start killing people is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable
sanders,0,if that is the point i have to tell you i disagree
sanders,0,i disagree because you hold people — in terms of this liability thing where you hold manufacturers liability is if they understand that theyre selling guns into an area that — its getting into the hands of criminals of course they should be held liable
sanders,0,but if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally what youre really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in america
sanders,0,i dont agree with that
clinton,1,well that — that is not — that is not what happened and i think its important for people to understand
clinton,1,because of the proliferation of guns because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country there were a group of cities states and other concerned people who in the late 90s and in the early 2000s were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible
clinton,1,the nra saw this happening and they said weve got to stop it
clinton,1,last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable
clinton,1,so the nra went to the congress and the head of the nra has said this was the most important nra legislation in more than 20 years
clinton,1, and they basically went to the congress — i was there
clinton,1,i was in the senate
clinton,1,and they said give us absolute immunity
clinton,1,no other industry in america has absolute immunitycrosstalk
clinton,1,and they sell products all the time that cause harm applause
sanders,0,so lets say this
sanders,0,lets say this
clinton,1, and theyre held responsible
sanders,0,if i understand — and — you know as i understand it what youre really talking about is not what secretary clinton is responding to
sanders,0,as i understand it — and maybe im wrong on this but what you were essentially saying and what people are saying is that if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable
sanders,0,and if that is your position then what you are saying essentially — if that is the case as i understand it — its not what secretary clinton is talking about
sanders,0,i agree with what she said
sanders,0,but if that is the case then essentially your position is there should not be any guns in america period
sanders,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,that is like the nra position
clinton,1,no
sanders,0,can i — can i finish please
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,and you can — there are people who hold that view
sanders,0,and thats fine if you hold it
sanders,0,i think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable
sanders,0,you try to make
sanders,0, guns as safe as possible but i would disagree on that
clinton,1,anderson i just want to finish because this — i know some of the parents from sandy hook
clinton,1,i want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first grader little backpack maybe on his or her back and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon an ar 15 and murdered those children
clinton,1,now they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family
sanders,0,hold
clinton,1,and the best way to do that is to go right at the people
clinton,1, you talk about corporate greed
sanders,0,hold it
clinton,1,the gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,you know i think it is a little bit — it is a little bit — look what happened at sandy hook what happened in michigan what has happened far too often all over this country is a terrible terrible tragedy and we have got to do everything we can as i mentioned a moment ago to end these mass killings
sanders,0,but as i understand what your question is — and youre not the only person whose heart was broken
sanders,0,i know i was there in the senate when we learned about this killing
sanders,0,it is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a — i mean it is hard to even talk about it
sanders,0,we all feel that way
sanders,0,but it as i understand it anderson and maybe im wrong what youre really talking about is people saying lets end gun manufacturing in america
sanders,0,thats the implications of that and i dont agree with that
clinton,1,well dont let me say this senator sanders voted for that bill we both supported it
clinton,1,and i think its fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate and people from all communities were asking that action be taken
clinton,1,now my husband said at the naacp last summer that it solved some problems but it created other problems and i agree
clinton,1,and one of those problems was unfortunately a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated not just at the federal level which is what this bill about but in states and localities as well
clinton,1,and thats why the very first speech that i gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration because i believe absolutely that too many families were broken up too many communities were adversely affected
clinton,1,so weve got to do a bunch of things
clinton,1,on the criminal justice side look weve got to have better policing
clinton,1,that means body cameras that means ending profiling that means doing everything we can to make sure theres respect between the community and the police
clinton,1,and when it comes to incarceration
clinton,1, that means we have to limit mandatory minimums we have to end disparities and treatment at last through incarceration
clinton,1,well senator sanders voted for it as well
clinton,1,are you going to ask him the same question
sanders,0,probably will
clinton,1,i just said that
clinton,1,he said at the naacp that there were some aspects that worked well
clinton,1,the violence against women provisions have worked well for example
clinton,1,but other aspects of it were a mistake and i agree
clinton,1,thats why im focused and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system ending private prisons ending the incarceration of low level offenders and i am committed to doing that
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,you know as i think secretary clinton knows as we all know there are bills in congress that have bad stuff there are bills in congress that have good stuff
sanders,0,good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill
sanders,0,now if i have voted against that bill secretary clinton would be here tonight and shed say bernie sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons
sanders,0,bernie sanders voted against the violence against women act
sanders,0,those were provisions in the bill as the secretary just indicated
sanders,0,so in that bill there was some good provisions i have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since i was mayor in burlington
sanders,0,violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country it was in that bill
sanders,0,the ban on assault weapons thats what i have fought for my whole life
sanders,0,it was in that bill
sanders,0,now what you are reading though is i went to the floor as i recall and thats what i said
sanders,0,i tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out
sanders,0,secretary clinton have a disagreement
sanders,0,i was then and i am now opposed to the death penalty
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,so to answer your question what you read was a congressman who was torn who said there are good things in that bill there are bad things overall
sanders,0,i voted for it
sanders,0,but where we are right now is having more than 22 million people in jail — more than any other country on earth
sanders,0,this is a campaign promise at the end of my first term we will not have more people in jail than any other country
sanders,0,you are not talking about me are you
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,well i think the best answer — i dont know that i can give you a definitive answer here but i will give you this answer
sanders,0,when i was a young man at the university of chicago i worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the university of chicago owned housing
sanders,0,most candidates for president dont put this on their resume but i was arrested by the chicago police for trying to desegregate the chicago school system
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,in 1963 and an important day for me i went to the march on washington led by dr king for jobs and freedom
sanders,0,dr king has been an important inspiration for me
sanders,0,in this campaign if you go toberniesanderscom and read our position on criminal justice it is i believe the strongest position of any candidate
sanders,0,what it says among other things 51 percent of african american kids today are unemployed — you know were going to do
sanders,0,were going to provide education and jobs for those kids not jails or incarceration
clinton,1,let me go answer mr mcghees question because i think its a profound one
clinton,1,i think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when i was a teenager insisting that we go in to inner city chicago because i lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches
clinton,1,it was also important for me to be a baby sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives and to hear dr king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old
clinton,1,that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith
clinton,1,when i was in law school i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman named mary right adelman who worked with dr king who was the first african american woman who passed the mississippi bar
clinton,1,i asked her for a job and she said she didnt have any money
clinton,1,i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid she would give me a job
clinton,1,so i got law students a civil rights research council grant
clinton,1,the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails
clinton,1,the second thing she did was to send me to alabama to investigate segregated academies
clinton,1,so from that moment until today i am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the childrens defense fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything i can to address systemic racism
clinton,1,well don if i could i think being a white person in the united states of america i know that i have never had the experience that so many people the people in this audience have had
clinton,1,and i think its incumbent upon me and what i have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have the talk with your kids scared that your sons or daughters even could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like sandra bland and end up dead in a jail in texas
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and i have spent a lot of time with the mothers of african american children who have lost them trayvon martins mother
clinton,1,and ive gotten to know them
clinton,1,ive listened to them
clinton,1,and it has been incredibly humbling because i cant pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had
clinton,1,but i will do everything that i possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system in the employment system in the education and health care system
clinton,1,that is what i will try to do to deal with what i know is the racism that still stalks our country
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well let me just very briefly tell you a story
sanders,0,when i was in one of my first years in congress i went to a meeting downtown in washington dc and i went there with another congressman an african american congressman
sanders,0,and then we kind of separated during the meeting
sanders,0,and then i saw him out later on
sanders,0,and he was sitting there waiting and i said well lets go out and get a cab
sanders,0,how come you didnt go out and get a cab
sanders,0,he said no i dont get cabs in washington dc
sanders,0,this was 20 years ago
sanders,0,because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black
sanders,0,i couldnt believe you know you just sit there and you say this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington dc tell you another story i was with young people active in the black lives matter movement
sanders,0,a young lady comes up to me and she says you dont understand what police do in certain black communities
sanders,0,you dont understand the degree to which we are terrorized and im not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen which have got to end and weve got to hold police officers accountable im just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people
sanders,0,so to answer your question i would say and i think its similar to what the secretary said when youre white you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto
sanders,0,you dont know what its like to be poor
sanders,0,you dont know what its like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car
sanders,0,and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016 we must be firm in making it clear
sanders,0,we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,its not a question of being better than president obama it is a question of building on the work that president obama has done the very important work
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,no well he has given us a good good basis and foundation
sanders,0,we have got to do better than that
sanders,0,and of course we should
sanders,0,but heres what i would do
sanders,0,i would end — i would make sure that the department of justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody
sanders,0,i would end the militarization of local police departments
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i would develop model programs to make police departments look like the communities that they serve
sanders,0,i would end minimal sentencing and give judges more discretion
sanders,0,i would recognize that substance abuse and drug addiction is a health issue not a criminal issue
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i would make sure that those people who left jail had the education and job training so they dont go back into the same environment which got them in jail in the first place
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country
clinton,1,i think it was a poor choice of words i never used it before i havent used it since i would not use it again
clinton,1,because my whole life to go back to what i was saying to mr mcgee is you know really ever since i went to work for the childrens defense fund is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind
clinton,1,and i know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty who are going to schools like the ones in detroit that have mold and rodents in them
clinton,1,i saw that in south carolina
clinton,1,its unfortunately across america
clinton,1,so what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child
clinton,1,thats why i believe in supporting families early childhood education universal pre kindergarten help kids be successful
clinton,1,and here is flint weve got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead because too many kids are having the experiences ive been told about where theyre falling back in school where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure
clinton,1,so were going to have to do even more here than we would do in most other counties
sanders,0,but can i respond to that briefly
sanders,0,just in this
sanders,0,i am not sure which legislation that was
sanders,0,but i think it may have been the welfare reform so called
clinton,1,no it was the crime bill
sanders,0,oh it was the crime bill
clinton,1,crime bill
sanders,0,but during that same period 96
sanders,0,there was a bill called — so called it had a long title to it welfare reform bill
sanders,0,and this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country
sanders,0,i strongly opposed that legislation
sanders,0,secretary clinton had a different position then
sanders,0,and what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that — really a bill that was written by republicans
sanders,0,bad bill
clinton,1,well once again if were going to argue about the 90s lets try to get the facts straight
clinton,1,that bill had a lot of provisions that unfortunately were stripped out by george w bush by republican governors
clinton,1,and i disagreed with the way it was applied
clinton,1,and i have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years
clinton,1,but if we are going to talk about the 90s lets talk about 23 million new jobs incomes went up for everybody
clinton,1,the median african  american income went up 33 percent at the end of the 90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history
clinton,1,so we were on the right path
clinton,1,more jobs rising incomes
clinton,1,along came george w bush and trickle down economics and brought us the great recession which thank goodness president obama has been digging us out of ever since
sanders,0,secretary clinton is right
sanders,0,in the 1990s we created a whole lot of jobs
sanders,0,good
sanders,0,and i supported many of your husbands initiatives
sanders,0,but in the 1990s you know what we also did
sanders,0,we deregulated wall street which allowed wall street to end up destroying our economy
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,we passed nafta and other disastrous trade agreements which had a horrendous impact on african americans in particular in flint in detroit and all across this country
sanders,0,so when we talk about the 90s youre right
sanders,0,a lot of good things happened but a lot of bad things happened
sanders,0,i voted against those trade agreements
sanders,0,and i voted against wall street deregulation
sanders,0,well thank you very much for not being resigned to that horrendous situation but being prepared to stand up and fight back
sanders,0, thats what we need all over this country
sanders,0,and let me be very honest with you hard thing to say but it is true
sanders,0,a great nation is judged not by how many millionaires and billionaires it has but by how it treats the most vulnerable amongst us and that is the children and that is the elderly
sanders,0,and do you know what
sanders,0,we should be ashamed of how we treat our kids and our senior citizens
sanders,0,we have a republican leadership in congress now fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two tenths of one percent but somehow we cant come up with the money to fix detroits crumbling public school system
sanders,0,somehow we cannot make sure that detroit has qualified and good teachers
sanders,0,somehow we cant make sure that there are summer programs for your children and after school programs for your children
sanders,0,somehow we cannot do what other countries around the world is provide quality childcare and pre k we have got to change our national priorities no more tax breaks for billionaires and large corporations
sanders,0,we are going to invest in our children and have the best public school system in the world
sanders,0, anderson not only do we have a crumbling school system in detroit and in many other areas we have — and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth
sanders,0,that is a disgrace
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,so when you ask me about my priorities my priorities are that no were not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy
sanders,0,were going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country in detroit in vermont gets the quality education that he or she deserves
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,mrs kim here is what i would do as president
clinton,1,number one i would reinstate a program we did have during the 1990s where the federal government provided funding to repair and modernize public schools because a lot of communities cant afford to do that on their own
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,secondly i would use every legal means at my disposal to try to force the governor and the state to return the schools to the people of detroit — to end the emergency managementapplause and cheeringwhich i believe if you look at the data the situation has only gotten worse with these emergency managers that have put the system further in debt
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,number three i want to set up inside the department of education for want of a better term kind of an education swat team if you will
clinton,1,where weve got qualified people teachers principals maybe folks who are retired maybe folks who are active but all of whom are willing to come and help
clinton,1,when detroit gets back their schools they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired
clinton,1,and i also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because were going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts applause
clinton,1, including detroit
clinton,1,you know i am proud to have been endorsed by the aft and the nea and ive had very good relationship with both unions with their leadership
clinton,1,and weve really candid conversations because we are going to have to take a look at — what do we need in the 21st century to really involve families to help kids who have more problems than just academic problems
clinton,1,a lot of what has happened and honestly it really pains me a lot of people have blaming and scape goating teachers because they dont want to put the money into the schools system that deserve the support that comes from the government doing its job
clinton,1,you know what   i have told my friends at the top of both unions weve got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms
clinton,1,we need to eliminate the criticism
clinton,1,you know teachers do so much good they are often working under most difficult circumstances
clinton,1,so anything that could be changed i want them to look at it
clinton,1,i will be a good partner to make sure that whatever i can do as president i will do to support the teachers of our country
sanders,0,what our campaign is about is asking people to think big not small
sanders,0,and when we think big and we talk about education weve got to ask ourselves a simple question how is it — starting at college that hundreds of thousands of bright young people are today unable to go to college because they cant afford it
sanders,0,how is it that maybe your kid — and when i was growing up we didnt have any money — were not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world
sanders,0,so starting with the top now i know some people think its a radical idea i dont
sanders,0,i believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,so that your child regardless of the income of your family knows that if shes studies hard she is going to be able to go to college
sanders,0,and you know what else we do
sanders,0,we invest in child care
sanders,0,right now youve got child care workers making mcdonalds wages that is crazy
sanders,0,i want well trained well paid child care workers to give our youngest kids advance opportunities
clinton,1,well theres no doubt we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs
clinton,1,heres what id do   the congress finally got around to pass the highway transportation bill which should never have been partisan   it turned into be one partisan argument
clinton,1,i want to go further
clinton,1,i want to put 250 billion dollars additional on top of what congress has done
clinton,1,that gets us to a half a billion
clinton,1,i want to start a national infrastructure bank
clinton,1,i want to capitalize it with 25 billion that i believe will leverage 10 times that thats another 250 billion
clinton,1,so im trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but theres no doubt we have to do more on our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports
clinton,1,and as weve talked in the beginning here under our ground our water systems our sewer systems
clinton,1,we have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous
clinton,1,we have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work i think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it
sanders,0,well lets begin by discussing the problem
sanders,0,as youve indicated the american society of civil engineers say we need trillions of dollars — trillions of dollars — just to bring up our infrastructure to deal with — water systems like flint just to bring them up to decent levels
sanders,0,we have suggested a trillion dollar investment
sanders,0,now you know how were gonna pay for that
sanders,0,ill tell you how were gonna pay for that
sanders,0,right now this country is losing $100 billion every single year because profitable corporations are stashing their profits in the cayman islands bermuda and in other tax havensapplauseand in some cases not paying five cents in federal income tax
sanders,0,i will eliminate that outrageous loophole and we will raise $1 trillion
sanders,0,and by the way not only do we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure — $1 trillion over five years creates 13 million decent paying jobs
clinton,1,you know i dont support it when any locality or any state is against it number one
clinton,1,i dont support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present
clinton,1,i dont support it — number three — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using
clinton,1,so by the time we get through all of my conditions i do not think there will be many places in america where fracking will continue to take place
clinton,1,and i think thats the best approach because right now there places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated
clinton,1,so first weve got to regulate everything that is currently underway and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that i just mentioned are met
sanders,0,my answer — my answer is a lot shorter
sanders,0,no i do not support fracking
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and by the way — by the way anderson im glad you raised the issue of climate change because the media doesnt talk enough about what the scientists are telling us and that is if we dont get our act togetherapplausethe planet that were gonna leave our children may not be healthy and habitable
sanders,0,i have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the senate which among other things calls for a tax on carbon massive investmentsapplausein energy efficiency wind solar and other sustainable energy
sanders,0,this is a crisis we have got to deal with now
sanders,0,yes
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,you know — you know one of the differences — look secretary clinton — and ive said this before and i admit it — she has the support of all the governors — democratic — all the senators all the congressmen
sanders,0,i dont
sanders,0,i am not part of that establishment
sanders,0,i plead guilty
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i happen to be a member of the environmental committee
sanders,0,i have talked to scientists all over the world
sanders,0,and what they are telling me — if we dont get our act together this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century — cataclysmic problems for this planet
sanders,0,this is a national crisis
sanders,0,and i talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country
sanders,0,we have gotta be bold now
sanders,0,we gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy
sanders,0,weve gotta do it yesterday
clinton,1,yeah
clinton,1,yeah
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,no what i am suggesting is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system
sanders,0,and instead of standing up to that finance system applause
sanders,0,and instead of standing up to that finance system secretary clinton has super pac which is raising huge amounts — well i hate to say the word huge every time i say huge itlaughter
sanders,0,a lot of money from wall street and from the fossil fuel industry
sanders,0,i am doing it a different way
sanders,0,i have 5 million individual contributors who have gone to berniesanderscom to make a $27 contribution
sanders,0,i dont take money from the fossil fuel industry
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well first let me say i think i have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change
clinton,1,it sets some very big goals a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term if im so fortunate to be president
clinton,1,and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term
clinton,1,what i am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be
clinton,1,i worked with president obama during the four years i was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on china and india and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in paris
clinton,1,so i am committed to and focused on how we make that transition
clinton,1,ive already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas but it is important that people understand that a president cant go ordering folks around
clinton,1,our system doesnt permit that
clinton,1,i am going to set the goals
clinton,1,i will push everybody as hard as i can to achieve those goals
clinton,1,we will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i dont have any comment
clinton,1,i dont know that
clinton,1,i dont believe that there is any reason to be concerned about it
clinton,1,i admire what senator sanders has accomplished in his campaign
clinton,1,i have more than 850000 donors most of them give less than $100
clinton,1,i am very proud of that
clinton,1,and i just want to make one point
clinton,1,you know we have our differences
clinton,1,and we get into vigorous debate about issues but compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the republican stage last week
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well let me make a couple of responses
sanders,0,let me pick up on the last point the secretary made
sanders,0,you know we are if elected president going to invest a lot of money into mental health
sanders,0,and when you watch these republican debates you know why we need to invest in that
sanders,0,laughter and applause
sanders,0,but heres the difference
sanders,0,here is the difference
sanders,0,its not a personal difference
sanders,0,we just do things differently
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,i honestly — look we have a corrupt campaign finance system
sanders,0,and what secretary clinton is saying and what every candidate who receives from the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies or wall street say not going to impact me
sanders,0,the question the american people have to ask is why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if its not going to make a difference
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and that is why by the way that is why one of my top priorities if elected president will be to overturn this outrageous citizens united supreme court inaudible
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,and
clinton,1,and that is one of the many reasons we must all support president obamas right to nominate a successor to justice scalia and demand that the senate hold hearings and a vote on that successor because there are so many issues at stake
clinton,1,on the first day of my campaign i said we are going to reverse citizens united
clinton,1,and if we cant get it done through the court i will lead a constitutional amendment effort to reverse it that way
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well let me start by saying that the last time i checked as of last night donald trump had received 36 million votes which is a good number
clinton,1,and there is only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him and thats me
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and i am building a broad diverse coalition across our country
clinton,1,im very excited by the support were receiving
clinton,1,i have said and ill repeat here i think that donald trumps bigotry his bullying his bluster are not going to wear well on the american people
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,so i will look forward to engaging him because you know i dont think we need to make america great again
clinton,1,america didnt stop being great we have to make it whole again
clinton,1,we have to knock down the barriers we have to end the divisiveness we have to unify the country
clinton,1,and if im fortunate enough to be the nominee thats exactly what i will do
sanders,0, that was one of the nice things that he said about me
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,ill tell you something this is my right arm
sanders,0,im prepared to give — no i shouldnt say that
sanders,0,i would love to run against donald trump and ill tell you why
sanders,0,for a start but almost — not all but almost every poll has shown that sanders versus trump does a lot better than clinton versus trump
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,right here in michigan there was a poll done i think yesterday or today had me beating trump in michigan by 22 points
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,secretary clinton beat him as well but not by so much
sanders,0,and thats true nationally and in many other states
sanders,0,and the other reason i think we can beat trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement
sanders,0,just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in maine we won that tonight with a very large turnout
sanders,0,applause and cheering
sanders,0,we won nebraska we won kansas and kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history
sanders,0,i think we are exciting working class people young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us
sanders,0,and not just the few
sanders,0,well i think — well the answer is yes and i think when we talk about god whether it is christianity or judaism or islam or buddhism what we are talking about is what all religions hold dear
sanders,0,and that is to do unto others as you would like them to do unto you
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i am here tonight and im running for president
sanders,0,im a united states senator from my great state of vermont because i believe that because i believe morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on children in flint michigan who are being poisoned or veterans who are sleeping out on the street
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,what i believe as the father of seven beautiful grandchildren i want you to worry about my grandchildren and i promise you i will worry about your family
sanders,0,we are in this together
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,no
sanders,0,i am very proud to be jewish and being jewish is so much of what i am
sanders,0,look my fathers family was wiped out by hitler in the holocaust
sanders,0,i know about what crazy and radical and extremist politics mean
sanders,0,i learned that lesson as a tiny tiny child when my mother would take me shopping and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in hitlers concentration camp
sanders,0,i am very proud of being jewish and that is an essential part of who i am as a human being
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings
clinton,1,i pray very specifically for people whom i know by name
clinton,1,people who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times illness divorce death disappointment all of the life experiences that confront most of us
clinton,1,i pray for the will of god to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability try to follow it and fulfill it
clinton,1,i have said many times that you know i am a praying person and if i havent been during the time i was in the white house i would have become one
clinton,1,because its very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith
clinton,1,so i do pray for people in authority
clinton,1,i try to think about what they are going through even when i disagree with them
clinton,1,trying to find some common ground some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic
clinton,1,i dont always succeed
clinton,1,i will tell you that
clinton,1,so i pray on a pretty regular basis during the day because i need that strength and i need that support
clinton,1,and especially when you are in the position that im in and that senator sanders is in where you are asking people to vote for you to give you the most important job not only in our country but i would argue in the world
clinton,1,i think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if youre fortunate enough to that holding of office and thats what i will try to do
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,my father came to this country at the age of 17 without any money
sanders,0,never made any money
sanders,0,we lived in a three and half room rent controlled apartment
sanders,0,so i learned about economics not just in college but in living in a family that didnt have money that had to scrape by
sanders,0,we are here tonight in flint michigan because a horrendous tragedy is taking place
sanders,0,but its not just in flint michigan
sanders,0,we are have 29 million people who have no health insurance
sanders,0,were the only major country on earth that doesnt provide paid family and medical leave
sanders,0,we have school systems around america that are collapsing
sanders,0,and yet we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world
sanders,0,but most people dont know that because almost all of the new incoming wealth is going to the top one percent
sanders,0,i believe and with all due respect to my good friend secretary clinton that it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics
sanders,0,it is too late for a corrupt campaign finance system and super pacs that raise enormous amounts of money from special interests
sanders,0,we need in this country a political revolution where ordinary people stand up and reclaim the government that men and women fought and died for
sanders,0,thank you
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well im running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of america realizing its potential and every american having a chance to live up to his or her god given potential
clinton,1,we have a lot of work to do
clinton,1,we have economic barriers
clinton,1,thats why ive laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes
clinton,1,we have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care
clinton,1,thats why i will build on the affordable care act
clinton,1,we have barriers to education
clinton,1,thats why i want to start early and provide debt free tuition and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young americans
clinton,1,and i do want to take on the barriers of systemic racism
clinton,1,i may not have experienced them but i see the results every single day
clinton,1,so im asking for your support in the primary here in michigan on tuesday
clinton,1,im asking for it and i will do whatever i can as the democratic nominee to run a campaign youll be proud of
clinton,1,i dont intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate but instead to lift our sights to set big goals to make it clear that americas best days can be and are ahead of us
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,thank you very much
clinton,1,ive been looking forward to this debate and i want to thank univision the washington post facebook and miami dade college the largest college in north america for hosting us here this evening
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and tonight i am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead starting with the economic ones
clinton,1,my focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax making them pay back any tax breaks theyve gotten
clinton,1,but we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing
clinton,1,for small businesses and entrepreneurs for more clean energy jobs
clinton,1,and i also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president
clinton,1,and i will also be talking about education every child deserves a good teacher and a good school
clinton,1,and so thank you for having us and i look forward to the debate
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,thank you — thank you all very much
sanders,0,im running for president of the united states because given the crises facing our country it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics
sanders,0,together were going to have to overturn this disastrous citizens united supreme court decision
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,billionaires and wall street should not be buying elections
sanders,0,weve got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent and of course we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship
sanders,0,and here in miamiapplausehere in miami as much as any city in america we know that we have got to combat climate change transform our energy system and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren
clinton,1,well look i won one of the contests and lost another close one
clinton,1,i am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country
clinton,1,i was pleased that i got 100000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates
clinton,1,so this is a marathon and its a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that im running a campaign that reaches out to everybody a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress because i am a progressive who likes to get things done
clinton,1,so im excited about the upcoming contests including right here in florida
clinton,1,and well continue to work as hard as i can to earn the vote of every single voter
clinton,1,it was a very close race
clinton,1,weve had some of those
clinton,1,ive won some
clinton,1,ive lost some
clinton,1,but you know i was very pleased by the overall outcome last night
clinton,1,and now were on to the states for next tuesday and im looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them
sanders,0,well you know when we began this campaign i was 3% in the polls
sanders,0,i was probably 60 or 70 points behind the secretary
sanders,0,we have come a long way in 10 months
sanders,0,we have wonapplauseincluding michigan last night which some peopleconsidered one of the major political upsets in modern american history
sanders,0,we have won nine state primaries and caucuses
sanders,0,and i believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate america and wall street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country
sanders,0,and i think in the coming weeks and months we are going to continue to do extremely well win a number of these primaries and convince superdelegates that bernie sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well jorge theres a lot of questions in there
clinton,1,and im going to give the same answer ive been giving for many months
clinton,1,it wasnt the best choice
clinton,1,i made a mistake
clinton,1,it was not prohibited
clinton,1,it was not in any way disallowed
clinton,1,and as i have said and as now has come out my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government
clinton,1,but heres the cut to the chase facts
clinton,1,i did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time
clinton,1,what you are talking about is retroactive classification
clinton,1,and the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public i asked all my emails to be made public
clinton,1,then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in
clinton,1,and some other parts of the government were not exactly sure who has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified
clinton,1,theyve just said the same thing to former secretary colin powell
clinton,1,they have said were going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally
clinton,1,now i think he was right when he said this is an absurdity
clinton,1,and i think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification
clinton,1,i am not concerned about it
clinton,1,i am not worried about it and no democrat or american should be either
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,there was no permission to be asked
clinton,1,it had been done by my predecessors
clinton,1,it was permitted
clinton,1,oh for goodness — thats not going to happen
clinton,1,im not even answering that question
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,there is a process under way and that process will take its course
sanders,0,today in america the middle class is disappearing
sanders,0,we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality climate change threatens the whole planet 47 million people live in poverty
sanders,0,im going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country
sanders,0,that process specifically
clinton,1,karen im going to follow my friend senator sanders model here
clinton,1,if im so fortunate enough to be the democratic nominee there will be a lot of time to talk about him
clinton,1,i was the first one to call him out
clinton,1,i called him out when he was calling mexicans rapists
clinton,1,when he was engaging in rhetoric that i found deeply offensive
clinton,1,i said basta and i am pleased that othersapplauseothers are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric his demagoguery his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system
clinton,1,especially from somebody running for president who couldnt decide whether or not to disavow the ku klux klan and david duke
clinton,1,so people can draw their own conclusions about him
clinton,1,i will just end by saying this
clinton,1,you dont make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i think its un american
clinton,1,i think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with american values karen
clinton,1,and i am going to take every opportunity to criticize him to raise those issues
clinton,1,im not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses
clinton,1,i think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee by pointing out what he has said
clinton,1,what he claims to believe in the values hes promoting and i think thats a better way for the american people to draw their conclusions
sanders,0,this is what i think
sanders,0,i think that the american people are never going to elect a president who insults mexicans who insults muslims who insults women who insults african americans
sanders,0,and let us not forget that several years ago trump was in the middle of the so  called birther movement trying to delegitimize the president of the united states of america
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,you know i find it very interesting karen my dad was born in poland
sanders,0,i know a little bit about the immigrant experience
sanders,0,nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate
sanders,0,maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i am very pleased — i am very pleased that i think in the last national poll that i saw we were running 18 points ahead of donald trump
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,in 2003 i sponsored the dreamer act
clinton,1,i sponsored i think in every congress after that
clinton,1,i have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship
clinton,1,i think our best chance was in 2007 when ted kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform
clinton,1,we have republican support
clinton,1,we had a president willing to sign it
clinton,1,i voted for that bill
clinton,1,senator sanders voted against it
clinton,1,just think imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago
clinton,1,imagine how much more secure families would be in our country no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one no longer fearing that they would be found out
clinton,1,so i am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,poverty is increasing
sanders,0,and if wages are going down i dont know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than american workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now
sanders,0,end video clip
sanders,0,crosstalk
sanders,0,well you have guestworker programs that have been described by the southern poverty law center one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues as guestworkers programs akin to slavery where people came in
sanders,0,they were cheated
sanders,0,they were abused
sanders,0,they were humiliated
sanders,0,and if they stood up for their rights they would be thrown out of the country
sanders,0,of course that type of inaudible leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people
sanders,0,and i worked very hard on that issue
sanders,0,and of course i supported the 2013 immigration reform bill
sanders,0,and what i believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform if the congress does not do its job as president of the united states i will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done to do what president obama did and expand on that
sanders,0,well we do the best — we dont know
sanders,0,and i should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill as you may know lulac the major hispanic organization in his country also opposed that bill as did many other latino organizations
sanders,0,but to your point we have to do the best we can
sanders,0,i applaud president obama for his efforts on dapa and daca
sanders,0,and i think we have got to expand those efforts
clinton,1,if i couldapplause you know i think its very hard to make the case that ted kennedy barack obama me la raza united farmworkers dolores huerta leaders of the latino community would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery
clinton,1,that was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill
clinton,1,and i will go back to what i said
clinton,1,if we had been able to get that passed we would be so much further along now
clinton,1,im committed to defending dapa and daca
clinton,1,im committed to going even further to get more people deferred action to go as far as i can under the law
clinton,1,and i am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency
sanders,0,well when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants secretary clinton prevailed upon the governor of new york elliot spitzer who wanted to do the right thing and provide drivers license to these who were undocumented she said dont do it and new york state still does not do it
sanders,0,in vermont by the way i worked with officials and undocumented people in vermont do have the ability to get drivers license
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,when we talk about immigration the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies human tragedies of recent years is children came from honduras where theres probably more violence than almost any place in this country and they came into this country
sanders,0,and i said welcome those children into this country secretary clinton said send them back
sanders,0,thats a difference
clinton,1,let me — let me respond again because the misrepresentation cant go unanswered here
clinton,1,first of all that is something that is not fair about what i said
clinton,1,i did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country — on their own very often — many of them not making it
clinton,1,and when they got here they needed as i have argued for legal counsel due process to make a decision
clinton,1,we need to end private detention we need to end family detention
clinton,1,and in 2006 when senator sanders was running for the senate from vermont he voted in the house with hard line republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants and then he sided with those republicans to stand with vigilantes known as minute men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants
clinton,1,so i think when you were running for the senate you made it clear by your vote senator that you were going to stand with the republicans
clinton,1,when you got to the senate in 2007 one of the first things you did was vote against ted kennedys immigration reform which hed been working on for years before you ever arrived
sanders,0,let me respond — let me respond to that
sanders,0,you know ted kennedy was a very close friend of mine and i served on the committee he chaired the health education labor committee
sanders,0,and ted kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008 i believe in congress dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in immokalee florida
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i went there on my own
sanders,0,wasnt an issue really for the state of vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery if you like that those workers lived under
sanders,0,and the result of that hearing and the work that many many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,great
clinton,1,thank you
clinton,1,heres what i can promise jorge i can promise that i will do everything possible to provide due process
clinton,1,let me say this
clinton,1,i would give every person but particularly children due process to have their story told
clinton,1,and a lot of children will of course have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay
clinton,1,end video clip
clinton,1,yes you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum
clinton,1,and we have laws
clinton,1,that was the most critical thing i said
clinton,1,under our laws
clinton,1,i would like to see those laws changed
clinton,1,i would like see added to them a guaranteed counsel and other support for children
clinton,1,but if you are asking about everyone who is already here undocumented immigrants the 11 12 million who are living here my priorities are to deport violent criminals terrorists and anyone who threatens our safety
clinton,1,so i do not have the same policy as the current administration does
clinton,1,i think its important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform but at the same time stop the raids stop the round ups stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives doing their jobs and thats my priority
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i will not deport children
clinton,1,i would not deport children
clinton,1,i do not want to deport family members either jorge
clinton,1,i want to as i said prioritize who would be deported violent criminals people planning terrorist attacks anybody who threatens us
clinton,1,thats a relatively small universe
clinton,1,i will not
clinton,1,thats what im telling you
clinton,1,now i dont want — because im not contradicting what i told you in the interview
clinton,1,asylum is a particular legal process
clinton,1,id like to see it changed
clinton,1,id like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do
clinton,1,but under our law we have a process we have to go through which is different
clinton,1,i would stop
clinton,1,yes
clinton,1,of the people the undocumented people living in our country i do not want to see them deported
clinton,1,i want to see them on a path to citizenship
clinton,1,that is exactly what i will do
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me just say this
sanders,0,i dont think that the secretary fully answered your question and i think the proof may be in the pudding
sanders,0,honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere
sanders,0,gang lords vicious people torturing people doing horrible things to families
sanders,0,children fled that part of the world to try try try try maybe to meet up with their family members in this country taking a route that was horrific trying to start a new life
sanders,0,secretary clinton did not support those children coming into this country
sanders,0,i did
sanders,0,now i happen to agree with president obama on many many issues
sanders,0,i think he has done a great job as president of the united states
sanders,0,he is wrong on this issue of deportation
sanders,0,i disagree with him on that
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,so to answer your question no i will not deport children from the united states of america
sanders,0,i can make that promise
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,this is why i go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear view mirror
clinton,1,i want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if im so fortunate enough to be president
clinton,1,and we do have to take a look at asylum laws
clinton,1,when i was secretary of state i worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in central america
clinton,1,i was there meeting with leaders security leaders and others
clinton,1,and i think the congress should support the presidents request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in central america helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me just answer i want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill
sanders,0,its true ted kennedy a good friend of mine and i think of the secretarys did work very hard on that bill
sanders,0,but does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good as the secretary is touting that lulac and other major latino organizations the largest latino organizations in this country said no to that bill
sanders,0,and i worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill i strongly supported people who were in the guest worker program in america would not be treated like slaves
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,let me just conclude by saying that united farm workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants
clinton,1,they have proven to be right in the succeeding years
clinton,1,i only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next congress
clinton,1,and as i said earlier in 2006 senator sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation
sanders,0,its
clinton,1,and stood with the minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous absurd efforts to quote hunt down immigrants
clinton,1,so look i think the goal here is to elect a democratic senate elect a democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,im sorry
sanders,0,of course not
sanders,0,there was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the house which codified existing legislation
sanders,0,what the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it
sanders,0,no i did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry
sanders,0,no i do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement an unfair statement to make
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i will stand inaudible of my career political career fighting for workers fighting for the poorest people in this country
sanders,0,madame secretary i will match my record against yours any day of the week
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well lets do that
clinton,1,lets talk about that
clinton,1,lets talk about that
clinton,1,lets talk about the auto bailout because i think its important for people to understand what happened
clinton,1,in december of 2008 we were both in the senate there was a vote on a free standing bill to rescue the auto industry
clinton,1,we both voted for it
clinton,1,was the right vote
clinton,1,unfortunately it did not succeed
clinton,1,the republicans marshalled the votes against it
clinton,1,a month later in january a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue
clinton,1,then president elect obama — before hed even been sworn in — sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it
clinton,1,he was still in the senate i was still in the senate
clinton,1,and i voted for it
clinton,1,it was a hard vote
clinton,1,ill tell you it was a hard vote
clinton,1,a lot of the votes you make are hard votes
clinton,1,but the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill
clinton,1,now senator sanders voted against it
clinton,1,thats his perfect right to vote against it
clinton,1,but if everyone had voted as he voted
sanders,0,yeah let me
clinton,1, we would not have rescued the auto industry
sanders,0,let me — lets — so that everybody knows the bill that secretary clinton is talking about that is — that was the bailout of the recklessness irresponsibility and illegal behavior of wall street
sanders,0,it was the wall street bailout
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i find it interesting that when secretary clinton who was the former senator of new york of course when she defended her vote she said well its going to help the big banks in new york
sanders,0,those are my constituents
sanders,0,and then you go to detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers
sanders,0,there was an article just yesterday
sanders,0, where people like senator bayh and ron wyden byron dorgan
sanders,0,former senators said no this wasnt the automobile bailout
sanders,0,it was the bailout of wall street
clinton,1,well i think both of us both senator sanders and i voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border
clinton,1,we increased the number of border security agents
clinton,1,we did vote for money to build a fence a pedestrian fence in some place a vehicle fence in other places
clinton,1,and the result is that we have the most secure border weve ever had
clinton,1,apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest theyve been in 40 years which just strengthens my argument that now its time to do comprehensive immigration reform
clinton,1,the republicans the opponents no longer have an argument
clinton,1,and certainly we hear a lot coming from the republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality
clinton,1,we raised money through the congressional appropriations process
clinton,1,we enhanced the border security
clinton,1,that part of the work is done
clinton,1,everybody that i know has looked at it said okay we have a secure border
clinton,1,theres no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery thats still —is carried out on the republican side
clinton,1,youve run out of excuses
clinton,1,lets move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship
clinton,1,and i think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it
clinton,1,its a big difference
clinton,1,first of all as i understand him hes talking about a very tall wall
clinton,1,laughter
clinton,1,right
clinton,1,a beautiful tall wall
clinton,1,the most beautiful tall wall better than the great wall of china that would run the entire border
clinton,1,that he would somehow magically get the mexican government to pay for
clinton,1,and you know its just fantasy
clinton,1,and in fact if he cared to know anything about what members of congress like the senator and i have done where it was necessary we did support some fencing
clinton,1,where it was necessary we did add border patrol agents
clinton,1,we have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job quote securing the border
clinton,1,so lets get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform
sanders,0,let me just say
sanders,0,i think the secretary and i mostly i think agree on this issue
sanders,0,look in this country immigration reform is a very hot debate
sanders,0,its divided the country
sanders,0,but i would hope very much that as we have that debate we do not as donald trump and others have done resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,this idea of suddenly one day or maybe a night rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar absurd idea that i would hope very few people in america support
sanders,0,well i absolutely support that
sanders,0,at the heart of my immigration policy and i should say that the new york times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running
sanders,0,but to answer your question the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families not to divide families
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,the idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral
sanders,0,a number of months ago i talked to a young man who was serving in the united states military and while he was serving in the military his wife was deported
sanders,0,that is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist
sanders,0,so maam i will do everything that i can to unite your family
sanders,0,your children deserve to be with their mother
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,first of all please know how brave i think you are coming here with your children to tell your story
clinton,1,this is an incredible act of courage that im not sure many people really understand
clinton,1,and i want you to know that in the work that ive done and the many families that ive met i have heard similar stories like yours where your husband is deported
clinton,1,your childrens father is gone
clinton,1,you are doing your very best to support your children
clinton,1,but it is time to bring families together
clinton,1,and i dont think theres any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more americans know what the human cost of these policies are
clinton,1,and i will do everything i can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing
clinton,1,and i will do everything i can to pass laws that would bring families back together
clinton,1,and i hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that president obama has put into place daca and dapa because i will defend those and i will absolutely protect your children yourself and try to bring your family back together
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well first karen obviously its painful for me to hear that
clinton,1,and i do take responsibility
clinton,1,when youre in public life even if you believe that its not an opinion that you think is fair or founded you do have to take responsibility
clinton,1,and i do
clinton,1,and i also have you know very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people
clinton,1,thats something that i care deeply about
clinton,1,and i will continue to do that to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me
clinton,1,that is certainly what happened to me in new york where people got to know me
clinton,1,they saw me in action
clinton,1,and they did
clinton,1,look i have said before and it wont surprise anybody to hear me say it this is not easy for me
clinton,1,its not easy to do what i think is right to help people to even the odds to hear a story like the womans story we just heard
clinton,1,and to know that i can make a difference and i want to in every way possible
clinton,1,i am not a natural politician in case you havent noticed like my husband or president obama
clinton,1,so i have a view that i just have to do the best i can get the results i can make a difference in peoples lives and hope that people see that im fighting for them and that i can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families
sanders,0,well what i have said is that when you get i believe it is $225000 for giving a speech and she gave several speeches to goldman sachs one of the wall street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago when you get paid $225000 that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for you would like to share it with the american people
sanders,0,so i think she should release the transcript
sanders,0,laughter and applause
sanders,0,crosstalk
sanders,0,as the secretary said well she will do it if other people do it
sanders,0,i will do it
sanders,0,i didnt give any speeches there is no transcript
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,that is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us
sanders,0,this i do know
sanders,0,this i do know
sanders,0,there is a reason why wall street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretarys super pac
sanders,0,now the secretary says it doesnt influence her
sanders,0,well thats what every politician says who gets money from special interests
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,the question that the american people have to determine   you know can you say that wall street is greedy theyre fraudulent but theyre not dumb
sanders,0,why are they making those kind of large contributions
clinton,1,well let me respond as i have numerous times during this campaign
clinton,1,you know i have a public record and you can go look it up
clinton,1,i went to wall street before the great recession and basically called them out said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk called for a moratorium on foreclosures
clinton,1,i went to the orlando area during the 08 campaign to make the same case visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk
clinton,1,i called for those changes
clinton,1,i have been on the record and now i do have the toughest most comprehensive plan to go after wall street
clinton,1,and not just the big banks all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy
clinton,1,and i have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail and i will use the powers that have now been passed by the congress by president obama who incidentally took a lot of money from wall street which didnt stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the great depression
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,look clearly clearly the secretarys words to wall street has really intimidated them and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions
sanders,0,now what i believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system
sanders,0,and its not just wall street its the drug companies inaudible received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry
sanders,0,weve got to overturn citizens united and end that
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,wait a minute
clinton,1,i just think its worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry the koch brothers have just paid to put up an ad praising senator sanders
clinton,1,there are a lot of different powerful interests in washington
clinton,1,ive taken them on
clinton,1,i took on the drug companies
clinton,1,i took on the insurance companies
clinton,1,before there was something called obamacare there was something called hillarycare and i worked really hardapplauseto get comprehensive health care reform and they beat me
clinton,1,so i have a long record of standing up to special interests
clinton,1,and i will continue to do so
sanders,0,there is nobody in the united states congress who has taken on the koch brothers who want to destroy social security medicare medicaid and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that bernie sanders
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and i am proud that the gentleman who is head of goldman sachs now he didnt give me $225000 for speaking fees he said i was dangerous and hes right
sanders,0,i am dangerous for wall street
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well if i can say
clinton,1, you know though i guess senator sanders that the koch brothers as you said are sensible with how they use their money
clinton,1,and i agree with you
clinton,1,they stand for things that i find abhorrent that would be bad for our country bad for our future
clinton,1,but they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only democrat who stood with the republicans to try to eliminate the export import bank which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in florida be able to export their goods and employ more floridians
clinton,1,so from my perspective you sided with the koch brothers
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,let me respond
sanders,0,the export import bank is often called the bank of boeing because boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue
sanders,0,it is corporate welfare and yes i oppose corporate welfare
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,you know look
clinton,1,i feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave americans that we lost at benghazi
clinton,1,and i certainly cant even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son but shes wrong
clinton,1,shes absolutely wrong
clinton,1,i and everybody in the administration all the people she named the president the vice president susan rice we were scrambling to get information that was changing literally by the hour
clinton,1,and when we had information we made it public
clinton,1,but then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it
clinton,1,so i testified for 11 hours
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that i answered every question that i was asked and when it was over the republicans had to admit they didnt learn anything
clinton,1,why
clinton,1,because there had already been one independent investigation
clinton,1,there had been seven or eight congressional investigations mostly led by republicans who all reached the same conclusions that there were lessons to be learned
clinton,1,and this is not the first time we lost americans in a terrorist attack
clinton,1,we lost 3000 people on 9 11
clinton,1,we lost americans serving in embassies in tanzania and kenya when my husband was president
clinton,1,we lost 250 americans both military and civilian when ronald reagan was president in beirut
clinton,1,and at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized applause
clinton,1,instead people said lets learn the lessons and save lives
clinton,1,and thats when i did
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,jorge that makes my point
clinton,1,at the time i e mailed with my daughter a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in benghazi
clinton,1,within 16 18 hours they rescinded taking credit
clinton,1,they did it all on social media
clinton,1,and the video did play a role
clinton,1,we have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video
clinton,1,this was fog of war
clinton,1,this was complicated
clinton,1,the most effective comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that
clinton,1,look as i said in the beginning i deeply regret that we lost four americans
clinton,1,and i of course sympathize with members of the families who are still you know very much grieving
clinton,1,and i wish that there could be an easy answer at the time but we learned a lot and the intelligence kept
clinton,1, improving and we learned enough to say what we think happened at benghazi
sanders,0,well im not going to comment on the benghazi tragedy but i will say this
sanders,0,a series of articles in the new york times talked about secretary clintons role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change getting rid of gadhafi in libya
sanders,0,gadhafi was a brutal dictator theres no question
sanders,0,but one of the differences between the secretary and i is im not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change
sanders,0,i voted against the war in iraq because i had a fear of what would happen the day after
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and secretary clinton talks about henry kissinger
sanders,0, winning the praise of henry kissinger i dont want henry kissingers praise at all
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well youve got to look at what the career is about
sanders,0,and this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country
sanders,0,i dont take money from wall street
sanders,0,i demand that we break up the large financial institutions
sanders,0,i dont take money from the pharmaceutical industry because i believe they are ripping off the american people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i dont take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying — they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing
sanders,0,so i think it is true that i have served in congress for many years
sanders,0,but if you check my record it is a record of strength for the environment for workers for seniors
sanders,0,unlike the secretary i believe we should expand social security benefits
sanders,0,it is a record of achievement for veterans working with republicans helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades
sanders,0,so i think the point is look at the record and its a record that i am proud of
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well i certainly know what all americans need and that is more jobs with rising incomes
clinton,1,its something that i have worked on for many years
clinton,1,its why ive laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs
clinton,1,and there are several things that need to be addressed
clinton,1,we do have to do more infrastructure spending
clinton,1,that will put many americans to work
clinton,1,its a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class
clinton,1,we need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs
clinton,1,we need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in america
clinton,1,we also do have to combat climate change and no state has more at stake in that than florida
clinton,1,and the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have but also the clean power plan that president obama has put forth that i support and the paris agreement that i think was a huge step forward in the world that senator sanders said was too weak but i helped to lay the groundwork for that
clinton,1,but we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses
clinton,1,you know the fastest growing segment of small businesses are minority and women owned small business and we need to help businesses get started
clinton,1,the very distinguished congresswoman from new york whos been on the small business committee congresswoman velasquez knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses
clinton,1,we do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women
clinton,1,that will help latinos as well as every other working person in our country
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,everything i just said will improve the living conditions and ive spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to latinos
clinton,1,jobs are the number one issue with rising incomes
clinton,1,close behind is education
clinton,1,every child deserves a good teacher in a good school regardless of the zip code that they live in
clinton,1,following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the affordable care act and provide access to health care
clinton,1,and then there are a number of other issues — comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top
sanders,0,ok let me answer that question because its a huge question
sanders,0,and one of the — huge i know
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,one of the points that ive been making and media does not seem to pick up on it is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in america being close to 10 percent but youth unemployment in this country
sanders,0,if you look at latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed
sanders,0,oh wait a minute
sanders,0,can i have
sanders,0, a little bit of time here please
sanders,0,african american kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent
sanders,0,thats why i co sponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because i would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,we have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour
sanders,0,the united states has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure
sanders,0,and when we do that under my plan we create 13 million decent paying jobs
sanders,0,no i do not propose free college tuition i proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities
sanders,0,yes i did
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,no
sanders,0,what they would — look this is what i believe jorge
sanders,0,this is the year 2016
sanders,0,fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy
sanders,0,today in many respects a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree
sanders,0,we have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,so i do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition free and i dont believe we should punish millions of young and not so young people with outrageous levels of student debt
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,absolutely
sanders,0,they can go — i dont think they will but donald trumps kids — donald trumps kids can go to public school right now i think secretary clinton is talking about making community colleges free they can go to those things
sanders,0,the point is we are going to get to donald trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires
sanders,0,but all of our people in my view regardless of income should have a right to get a higher education
sanders,0,i want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard no matter what the income of their families my family didnt have any income my parents didnt go to college they didnt have good income
sanders,0,i want every kid to know if you do your school work study hard yes you will be able to get a college education
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well congratulations on your education
clinton,1,and also on your plans for the future
clinton,1,and heres what i will do
clinton,1,were going to refinance everyones existing student debt 40 million americans have student debt
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and right now i go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent
clinton,1,its outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around
clinton,1,and you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate
clinton,1,you can refinance your car
clinton,1,corporations can refinance their debt
clinton,1,under my plan you will be able to also lower your debt move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that my plan for debt free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt
clinton,1,but for people who have it im going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years you no longer have to pay anything
clinton,1,the government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,i think what secretary clinton just said is absolutely right
sanders,0,i think i said it many months before she said it but thanks for copying a very good idea
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,now the question though you know i have been criticized a lot for thinking big
sanders,0,you know thats for believing that we can do great things as a nation
sanders,0,one of the things we should not be doing obviously is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,but here is the point
sanders,0,my program making public colleges and universities tuition free allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal about $70 billion a year
sanders,0,you know how im going to pay for it
sanders,0,im going to pay for it by imposing a tax on wall street speculation
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,we bailed out — secretary clinton was one of those who voted to bail out wall street
sanders,0,now i think its time for wall street to help the working families of this country
clinton,1,well im going to respond to that because i think its a very important issue
clinton,1,and by the way everybody who quote got money in the quote bailout that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back
clinton,1,so the treasury was out nothing
clinton,1,now that will no longer happen because we have dodd frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,but let me say this
clinton,1,senator sanders has talked about free college for everybody
clinton,1,hes talked about universal single payer health care for everybody
clinton,1,and yet when you ask questions as many of us have and more importantly independent experts its very hard to get answers
clinton,1,and a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything senator sanders is admitting to
clinton,1,this is going to increase the federal government dramatically
clinton,1,and you know my dad used to say if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
sanders,0,all right
sanders,0,let me respond to this
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,and we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for
sanders,0,i want you all to think
sanders,0,what secretary clinton is saying is that the united states should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all of our people
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i think if the rest of the world can do it we can
sanders,0,and by the way not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies we are spending far far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth
sanders,0,you may not think the american people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies
sanders,0,i think they are
sanders,0,and i think we can pass
clinton,1,this is a very important point in this debate because i do believe in universal coverage
clinton,1,remember i fought for it 25 years ago
clinton,1,i believe in it
clinton,1,and i know that thanks the affordable care act we are now 90 percent of universal coverage
clinton,1,i will build on the affordable care act
clinton,1,i will take it further
clinton,1,i will reduce the cost
clinton,1,but i just respectfully disagree
clinton,1,between the republicans trying to repeal the first chance weve ever had to get to universal health care and senator sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single payer i think the smart approach is build on and protect the affordable care act
clinton,1,make it work
clinton,1,reduce the cost
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,im on the committee i know a little bit about this im on the committee health education labor committee that helped write the affordable care act
sanders,0,and it has done a number of good things
sanders,0,but when secretary clinton says well 90 percent of the people have insurance yes not really
sanders,0,many of you may have insurance but you have outrageously high deductibles and co payments
sanders,0,one out of five americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe
sanders,0,elderly people are cutting their pills in half
sanders,0,i do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does and i think when the american people stand up and fight back yes we can have it a medicare for all health care system
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,well first of all karen when you have republican candidates for president and in congress telling you that climate change is a hoax which is donald trump and other candidates position what they are really saying is we dont have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,what candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies you know what happens to that republican who listens to the scientists
sanders,0,on that day that republican loses his campaign funding from the koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry
sanders,0,the way i would move forward in every other area
sanders,0,and what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president but im the only candidate who says no president not bernie sanders can do it all
sanders,0,you know what we need karen
sanders,0,we need a political revolution in this country
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,and when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits their short term profits are less significant than the long term health of this planet we will win
sanders,0,that is the way change always takes place
sanders,0,applause
clinton,1,well karen first of all i was proud a number of mayors from florida campaign for me in south carolina
clinton,1,i had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue
clinton,1,it is a really serious one
clinton,1,and there isnt much time left to do several things that i will move quickly to do
clinton,1,you can see already whats happening in miami particularly in miami beach with tides rising
clinton,1,so we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man made and man aggravated
clinton,1,and there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that i will absolutely support
clinton,1,all the republican say they will if theyre elected heaven forbid repeal all of those executive actions
clinton,1,i will maintain them and act on them
clinton,1,the clean power plan is something that senator sanders has said he would delay implementing which makes absolutely no sense
clinton,1,we need to implement all of the presidents executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy
clinton,1,that is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future
clinton,1,and when i talk about resilience i think that is an area we can get republican support on
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,let me be very clear
sanders,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,because — because after all — excuse me
sanders,0,i have introduced
clinton,1,excuse me excuse me
sanders,0,did you ask me to speak
clinton,1,after all there areapplause
clinton,1,crosstalk
sanders,0,madam secretary when he asked me to speak
clinton,1,you know you dont — you know you dont have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates
clinton,1,you know most of the property in florida will be at risk in the next 50 years
clinton,1,i think i can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the presidents orders until we frankly win back enough seats take back the senate and get back to bipartisancrosstalk
sanders,0,inaudible have as much time as she just had
sanders,0,thank you
sanders,0,lets be clear
sanders,0,youre looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the united states senate
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,now i hope that secretary clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy
sanders,0,and by the way while we are on the subject of energy i hope youll join me in ending fracking in the united states of america
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,crosstalk
clinton,1,well karen i do agree that we have to end the revolving door
clinton,1,i strongly support a piece of legislation from senator tammy baldwin that would do just that
clinton,1,and i will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first who will do more to try to make sure main street flourishes
clinton,1,and i will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed including to senator warren and many of my other former colleagues in the senate
clinton,1,but i think its important also to look at what we want to accomplish
clinton,1,you know in the debates weve had — maybe this is the seventh or so — senator sanders is always criticizing the two recent democratic presidents — president clinton and president obama
clinton,1,and thats fine but i wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing george w bush who i think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession
clinton,1,you know at the end of the 90s we had 23 million new jobs
clinton,1,incomes went up for everybody
clinton,1,we were talking earlier about what needs to be done for latinos and african americans
clinton,1,well we were doing it by the end of the 90s
clinton,1,median family income went up 17 percent
clinton,1,for minorities it went up even more
clinton,1,along came the republicans trickle down economics — one of the worst ideas since snake oil — was put back into place
clinton,1,and we ended up with the great recession
clinton,1,president obama had to rescue the economy
clinton,1,and i dont think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that
sanders,0,now let me say this
sanders,0,i gather secretary clinton hasnt listened to too many of my speeches
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,or followed my work in the congress as very few people stood up to george w bush whether it was the war in iraq or any other of his policies
sanders,0,laughter
sanders,0,now when we talk about the policies of the 1990s i worked closely and supported president clinton
sanders,0,and obviously i have worked very closely in supporting president obama who has taken our economy a very long way from where bush left us
sanders,0,but when you go back to the 1990s lets remember thats when wall street deregulation took place
sanders,0,thats when disastrous trade policies took place
sanders,0,yes good things happened but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems were having with a disappearing middle class today
clinton,1,well first of all i supported the presidents moves
clinton,1,i helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when i was secretary of state expanding travel opportunities remittances
clinton,1,and i certainly told the president toward the end of my time that i hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship
clinton,1,and there are no better ambassadors for freedom democracy and economic opportunity than cuban americans
clinton,1,so the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth the more likely we are to be able to move cuba toward greater freedom greater respect for rights
clinton,1,you know im looking forward to following the presidents trip
clinton,1,i do think meeting with dissidents meeting with people who have been voices tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important
clinton,1,the cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads
clinton,1,and i think both castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in cuba
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,i hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the cuban people and i hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in cuban soil and that the people of cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country
clinton,1,that is my hope
sanders,0,look i understand that not everybody in florida or in the united states will agree with me but i think we have got to end the embargo
sanders,0,applause
sanders,0,i believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with cuba
sanders,0,i think at the end of the day it will be a good thing for the cuban people
sanders,0,it will enable them i think when they see people coming into their country from the united states move in a more democratic direction which is what i want to see
sanders,0,so right — im sorry
sanders,0,sure
sanders,0,you may recall way back in when was it 1961 they invaded cuba and everybody was totally convinced that castro was the worst guy in the world
sanders,0,all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro
sanders,0,they forgot that he educated their kids gave them health care totally transformed their society
sanders,0,end video clip
sanders,0,well let me just answer that
sanders,0,what that was about was saying that the united states was wrong to try to invade cuba that the united states was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the nicaraguan government that the united states was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954 the government — democratically elected government of guatemala
sanders,0,throughout the history of our relationship with latin america weve operated under the so called monroe doctrine and that said the united states had the right do anything that they wanted to do in latin america
sanders,0,so i actually went to nicaragua and i very shortly opposed the reagan administrations efforts to overthrow that government
sanders,0,and i strongly opposed earlier henry kissinger and the — to overthrow the government of salvador aliende in chile
sanders,0,i think the united states should be working with governments around the world not get involved in regime change
sanders,0,and all of these actions by the way in latin america brought forth a lot of very strong anti american sentiments
sanders,0,thats what that was about
sanders,0,im sorry
sanders,0,please say that
sanders,0,the key issue here was whether the united states should go around overthrowing small latin american countries
sanders,0,i think that that was a mistake
sanders,0,both in nicaragua and cuba
sanders,0,look lets look at the facts here
sanders,0,cuba is of course an authoritarian undemocratic country and i hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country
sanders,0,but on the other handapplauseon the other hands it would be wrong not to state that in cuba they have made some good advances in health care
sanders,0,they are sending doctors all over the world
sanders,0,they have made some progress in education
sanders,0,i think by restoring full diplomatic relations with cuba it will result in significant improvements to the lives of cubans and it will help the united states and our business community invest
clinton,1,absolutely although it happens before i am president if i am so fortunate to be
clinton,1,i have been calling for months that the congress must give authority to puerto rico to restructure its debts
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt
clinton,1,and its a grave injustice for the congress led by the republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law
clinton,1,and what we see in puerto rico now is a lot of suffering
clinton,1,we see schools being closed we see health care being denied and we see a thousand puerto rican families a month moving to the united states mostly to florida
clinton,1,puerto ricans are citizen of america
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,they deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically
clinton,1,and i just want to add one thing to the question you were asking senator sanders
clinton,1,i think in that same interview he praised what he called the revolution of values in cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good not for themselves
clinton,1,i just couldnt disagree more
clinton,1,you know if the values are that you oppress people you disappear people you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions for expressing freedom of speech that is not the kind of revolution of values that i ever want to see anywhere
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,well as i said earlier i dont believe it is the business of the united states government to be overthrowing small countries around the world
sanders,0,and number two when you get to puerto rico theres an issue that we have not talked about
sanders,0,that little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent
sanders,0,and many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar
sanders,0,and what i have said in talking to the leaders of puerto rico weve got to bring people together
sanders,0,and its not the people of puerto rico or the children or the schools
sanders,0,but maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process
clinton,1,well i think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now
clinton,1,and i fully support president obamas intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to justice scalia
clinton,1,and i believeapplausei believe no state probably understands this better than florida
clinton,1,because lets remember three words bush versus gore
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,a court took away a presidency
clinton,1,now weve got the republican congress trying to take away the constitution
clinton,1,and we should not tolerate that
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,and so from my perspective it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the republicans in the senate to do their constitutional duty
clinton,1,now obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper but have a heart have life experience understand what these decisions mean in the lives of americans
clinton,1,and understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other
clinton,1,so clearly i would look for people who believe that roe v wade is settled law and that citizens united needs to be overturned as quickly as possible
clinton,1,applause
clinton,1,well thank you very much for a lively debate
clinton,1,and i appreciate greatly all the questions especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from facebook
clinton,1,it just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything i can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential and of our country doing the same
clinton,1,so i am going to take on those economic barriers
clinton,1,i have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes
clinton,1,im going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling
clinton,1,im going to take on the healthcare barriers
clinton,1,im going to do everything i can to make sure that we unite our country
clinton,1,i will find common ground just as i have as first lady as senator and secretary of state
clinton,1,i will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake
clinton,1,i would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on tuesday and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president
clinton,1,applause
sanders,0,this has been a wonderful debate but time being limited some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked
sanders,0,and that is is it acceptable that in america the top 01 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent
sanders,0,is it acceptable that while the average american works longer hours for lower wages 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent
sanders,0,is it acceptable that wall street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections
sanders,0,is that democracy or this that oligarchy
sanders,0,which is why i believe weve got to overturn citizens united and move to public funding of elections
sanders,0,is it right that in the greatest wealthiest country in the history of the world so many of our young people cant even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt in the wealthiest country in the history of the world
sanders,0,if we stand up fight back we can do a lot better
sanders,0,thats why im running for president
sanders,0,applause
